# This file tells the VS Code packaging tool which files to ignore.

# Exclude development-time artifacts and large output files
prompt.md
flattened_repo.md
log-state-logs.md
bootstrap-flattener.js

# Exclude reference directories
The-Creator-AI-main/

# Exclude project-specific VSCode settings
.vscode/

# Exclude source maps, which are not needed in the final package
**/*.map

# Exclude source files (they are compiled into dist/)
# We need to keep the Artifacts .md files for the Cycle 0 onboarding
# So we can't just ignore all of src.
# The below lines are commented out as they might be too aggressive
# and break runtime file reads from dist/ if not handled carefully.
# We will rely on the .gitignore and the specific file exclusions above for now.
# src/**/*.ts
# src/**/*.tsx
