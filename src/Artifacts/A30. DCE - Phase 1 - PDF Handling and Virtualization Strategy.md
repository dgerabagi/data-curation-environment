# Artifact A30: DCE - Phase 1 - PDF Handling and Virtualization Strategy
# Date Created: C49
# Author: AI Model

- **Key/Value for A0:**
- **Description:** Defines the strategy for handling PDF files. Text is extracted on-demand and cached in memory for flattening, creating a "virtual" markdown file without modifying the user's workspace.
- **Tags:** feature plan, pdf, text extraction, virtualization, cache, phase 1

## 1. Overview & Goal

Users need to include the textual content of PDF documents in their flattened context. However, creating physical `.md` files for each PDF in the user's workspace is undesirable as it clutters their project. The goal of this strategy is to implement a "virtual file" system for PDFs. The extension will extract text from PDF files on demand and hold it in an in-memory cache, using this virtual content during the flattening process without ever writing new files to the user's disk.

## 2. User Stories

| ID | User Story | Acceptance Criteria |
|---|---|---|
| PDF-01 | **Include PDF Text in Context** | As a user, when I check a `.pdf` file in the DCE view, I want its textual content to be included in the `flattened_repo.md` file, so I can use documents and papers as context. | - Checking a `.pdf` file is allowed. <br> - The token count displayed for the PDF reflects its extracted text content, not its binary size. <br> - When flattened, the text from the PDF is included within a `<file>` tag, just like a normal text file. <br> - No `.md` file is ever created in the user's workspace. |
| PDF-02 | **Drag-Drop PDF to Add** | As a user, I want to drag a PDF from my computer's file explorer and drop it into the DCE view, so I can quickly add it to my project and include it in my context. | - Dropping a PDF file into a folder in the DCE view copies the PDF into that workspace directory. <br> - The new PDF immediately appears in the file tree. <br> - The user can then check it to include its text content for flattening. |

## 3. Technical Implementation Plan

1.  **Dependency:**
    *   The `pdf-parse` library will be added as a dependency to `package.json` to handle text extraction from PDF buffers.

2.  **Backend (`fs.service.ts`):**
    *   **In-Memory Cache:** A new private cache will be added: `private pdfTextCache = new Map<string, { text: string; tokenCount: number }>();`. This will store the extracted text and calculated token count, keyed by the PDF's absolute path.
    *   **New IPC Handler (`RequestPdfToText`):**
        *   This handler will receive a file path for a PDF.
        *   It will first check the `pdfTextCache`. If the content is present, it will return the cached data.
        *   If not cached, it will read the PDF file into a buffer, use `pdf-parse` to extract the text, calculate the token count, store the result in the cache, and then return it.
        *   It will send a `UpdateNodeStats` message back to the client with the new token count.

3.  **Frontend (`view.tsx`):**
    *   **On-Demand Extraction:** The `updateCheckedFiles` function will be modified. When a path that ends in `.pdf` is being checked for the first time, it will send a `RequestPdfToText` message to the backend.
    *   **Dynamic Stats Update:** A new IPC listener for `UpdateNodeStats` will be added. When it receives a message, it will find the corresponding `FileNode` in the `files` state and update its `tokenCount` property, causing the UI to re-render with the correct information.

4.  **Backend (`flattener.service.ts`):**
    *   **Virtual Content Retrieval:** The `getFileStatsAndContent` method will be updated.
    *   If it encounters a file path ending in `.pdf`, it will **not** attempt to read the file from the disk.
    *   Instead, it will call a new method on the `FSService` (e.g., `getVirtualPdfContent(filePath)`) to retrieve the text from the `pdfTextCache`.
    *   It will then use this cached text to generate the `FileStats` object, effectively treating the PDF as if it were a markdown file. If the content is not in the cache (e.g., the file was never checked), it will be flattened with empty content.

5.  **External Drag-and-Drop:**
    *   This will be handled by the generic "External Drag-and-Drop" feature planned in `A23`. The implementation will read the file buffer and send it to the backend for creation, which works for PDFs just as it does for any other file type.
