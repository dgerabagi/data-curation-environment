# Artifact A89: DCE - vLLM Integration and API Proxy Plan
# Date Created: C29
# Author: AI Model & Curator

- **Key/Value for A0:**
- **Description:** Details the end-to-end plan for integrating the DCE with a remote vLLM instance via a secure proxy server, enabling high-throughput, parallelized AI responses.
- **Tags:** feature plan, vllm, llm, proxy, api, integration, performance

## 1. Vision & Goal

The goal of this integration is to unlock a new level of performance for the Data Curation Environment (DCE) by connecting its parallel response UI to a high-throughput vLLM backend. This will enable users to generate multiple, simultaneous AI responses with extremely low latency, dramatically accelerating the iterative development workflow.

To achieve this securely and flexibly, we will use the curator's existing `aiascent.game` server as a proxy, which will receive requests from the DCE extension and forward them to a dedicated vLLM instance.

## 2. End-to-End Architecture

The data will flow through three distinct components:

```
+---------------+      +---------------------------+      +----------------------+
| DCE Extension |----->|   aiascent.game (Proxy)   |----->|   vLLM Server        |
| (VS Code)     |      | (Node.js/Express Server)  |      | (Python Instance)    |
+---------------+      +---------------------------+      +----------------------+
```

1.  **DCE Extension (The Client):**
    *   The user will configure a "Model Card" in the DCE settings pointing to the proxy server's endpoint: `https://aiascent.game/api/dce/proxy`.
    *   When the user sends a prompt, the extension will make a `POST` request to this endpoint, sending the prompt data in the request body.
    *   It will be configured to handle a streaming response.

2.  **aiascent.game (The Proxy Server):**
    *   This server acts as a secure intermediary.
    *   A new API endpoint, `/api/dce/proxy`, will be added to `server.ts`.
    *   This endpoint will receive the request from the DCE extension.
    *   It will then create a new request to the internal vLLM server, whose address will be stored in an environment variable (e.g., `VLLM_URL=http://localhost:8000`).
    *   It will stream the response from the vLLM server back to the DCE extension client.

3.  **vLLM Server (The Inference Engine):**
    *   This is a dedicated Python process running the vLLM library.
    *   It will be configured to serve a specific model (e.g., `unsloth/gpt-oss-20b`) and will expose an OpenAI-compatible API endpoint.
    *   Its primary job is to handle the computationally intensive task of model inference with high efficiency through continuous batching.

## 3. Implementation Details

### 3.1. `server.ts` Modifications
A new route will be added to handle the proxy request. This route will use `node-fetch` or a similar library to make a server-to-server request to the vLLM instance and pipe the streaming response back.

**See Artifact `A90` for the proposed code.**

### 3.2. `Caddyfile` Configuration
The existing `Caddyfile` is already configured to reverse proxy all traffic to the Node.js server on port 3001. This configuration is sufficient and automatically handles HTTPS termination and header forwarding, so no changes are required.

**See Artifact `A91` for the full file and analysis.**

### 3.3. DCE Extension Configuration
The user will configure the connection in the DCE settings panel as follows:
-   **Model Card Name:** `Remote vLLM via AI Ascent`
-   **Endpoint URL:** `https://aiascent.game/api/dce/proxy`
-   **API Key:** (None required, as the proxy handles authentication if needed)

This architecture provides a secure, scalable, and highly performant solution for integrating the DCE with vLLM.
