# Artifact T4: Template - Technical Scaffolding Plan
# Date Created: C139
# Author: AI Model & Curator

- **Key/Value for A0:**
- **Description:** An example of a technical scaffolding plan.
- **Tags:** template, cycle 0, documentation, project setup

## 1. Overview

This document outlines the proposed technical scaffolding and file structure for **[Your Project Name]**. This plan serves as a blueprint for the initial project setup, ensuring a clean, scalable, and maintainable architecture from the start.

## 2. Technology Stack

-   **Language:** [e.g., TypeScript]
-   **Framework/Library:** [e.g., React, Node.js with Express]
-   **Styling:** [e.g., SCSS, TailwindCSS]
-   **Bundler:** [e.g., Webpack, Vite]

## 3. Proposed File Structure

The project will adhere to a standard, feature-driven directory structure:

```
.
├── src/
│   ├── components/       # Reusable UI components (e.g., Button, Modal)
│   │
│   ├── features/         # Feature-specific modules
│   │   └── [feature-one]/
│   │       ├── index.ts
│   │       └── components/
│   │
│   ├── services/         # Core backend or client-side services (e.g., api.service.ts)
│   │
│   ├── types/            # Shared TypeScript type definitions
│   │
│   └── main.ts           # Main application entry point
│
├── package.json          # Project manifest and dependencies
└── tsconfig.json         # TypeScript configuration
```

## 4. Key Architectural Concepts

-   **Separation of Concerns:** The structure separates UI components, feature logic, and core services.
-   **Component-Based UI:** The UI will be built by composing small, reusable components.
-   **Service Layer:** Business logic and external communication (e.g., API calls) will be encapsulated in services to keep components clean.
-   **Strong Typing:** TypeScript will be used throughout the project to ensure type safety and improve developer experience.
