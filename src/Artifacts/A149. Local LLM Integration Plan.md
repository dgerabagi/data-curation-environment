## 1. Overview & Goal

This document outlines the technical plan for integrating a locally hosted Large Language Model (LLM) into the "AI Ascent" game. The goal is to create a secure and robust connection between the game client/server and a local LLM endpoint (like one provided by LM Studio) to power new, dynamic gameplay features.

This integration will enable:
1.  An in-game helper bot, `@Ascentia`, that can answer player questions about the game.
2.  Interactive sessions where players can "talk" to their own AI products.
3.  A new "Poetry Battle" PvP competition between players' chatbot products.

## 2. Core Architecture: Backend Proxy

To ensure security and control, the game client will **never** directly call the local LLM endpoint. All communication will be routed through a dedicated backend API endpoint or WebSocket handler that acts as a proxy.

### 2.1. Rationale for a Backend Proxy
*   **Security:** Prevents malicious clients from directly accessing or overloading the local LLM server. It keeps the endpoint address and any potential API keys hidden from the client.
*   **Control:** Allows the server to inject, modify, or augment prompts before they are sent to the LLM. This is critical for:
    *   Adding system prompts and context for the `@Ascentia` helper bot.
    *   Injecting parameters to simulate quality degradation for the Poetry Battle.
    *   Enforcing rate limiting and preventing abuse.
*   **Flexibility:** The client-facing API remains consistent even if the underlying LLM provider or endpoint changes in the future.
*   **State Management:** The server can access the game's database (`prisma`) to fetch context for prompts (e.g., player stats, game rules from documentation artifacts).

### 2.2. Implementation: API Handlers in `server.ts`
*   The existing Express server (`src/server.ts`) will handle all LLM-related requests.
*   **Socket.IO `'start_ascentia_stream'` event:** This event is now used for all `@Ascentia` queries. It provides a streaming response for a better user experience.
*   **Socket.IO `'start_chatbot_stream'` event:** This event will be used for all streaming requests, specifically for the "Chat with Service" feature.
*   **`/api/llm/proxy` (POST):** This endpoint now handles only non-streaming, single-turn requests for features like the Player LLM Terminal.
*   The handlers for these routes and events will:
    1.  Authenticate the user session.
    2.  Based on the request's `context`, construct a final prompt string, potentially adding system instructions, game rules, or degradation parameters.
    3.  Use a server-side `fetch` to send the final, formatted request to the appropriate local LLM endpoint specified in an environment variable.
    4.  **For streaming:** The handler will read the `ReadableStream`, parse the SSE chunks, and emit the relevant `_stream_chunk` and `_stream_end` events back to the originating client socket.
    5.  **For non-streaming:** The handler will return the full response in the JSON body.

## 3. Local LLM Server Configuration (LM Studio)

### 3.1. Environment Variables (`.env` file)

To allow for flexible connections to different LLM servers (local, remote on the same network, or even production endpoints), the `server.ts` logic will prioritize URLs in the following order:

1.  **`REMOTE_LLM_URL` (NEW):** Use this to specify the address of an LLM running on a different machine on your local network. This is ideal for a two-PC development setup.
    *   **Example:** `REMOTE_LLM_URL=http://192.168.1.85:1234`
2.  **`LOCAL_LLM_URL`:** The standard variable for an LLM running on the same machine as the game server.
    *   **Example:** `LOCAL_LLM_URL=http://127.0.0.1:1234`
3.  **Hardcoded Default:** If neither environment variable is set, the server will fall back to `http://127.0.0.1:1234`.

The server will log which URL it is using upon startup for easy debugging.

### 3.2. Recommended Model & Settings
*   **Model:**
    *   **Identifier:** `qwen/qwen3-30b-a3b`
    *   **Context Length:** 32,768
*   **Server:**
    *   **Address:** Match the address in your `.env` file (e.g., `http://192.168.1.85:1234`).
    *   **Enable "Serve on Local Network"** in LM Studio if you are using `REMOTE_LLM_URL`.
    *   **Preset:** OpenAI API
*   **Hardware & Performance:**
    *   **GPU Offload:** Max
*   **Inference Parameters (Default for Creative/Chat Tasks):**
    *   **Temperature:** 0.8
    *   **Top K Sampling:** 40
    *   **Repeat Penalty:** 1.1
    *   **Top P Sampling:** 0.95
*   **Prompt Format:** For chatbot conversations sent to the `/v1/completions` endpoint, the prompt must be manually constructed using the model's chat template.

## 4. State Management: `llmStore.ts`

A new Zustand store will be created to manage the state of LLM-related interactions.

*   **`src/state/llmStore.ts`**
*   **State:**
    *   `isPlayerLlmTerminalOpen: boolean`
    *   `isPlayerChatbotInterfaceOpen: boolean`
    *   `isPoetryBattleViewerOpen: boolean`
    *   `productIdForInteraction: string | null`
    *   `activePoetryBattle: PoetryBattleState | null`
*   **Actions:**
    *   `openLlmTerminal(productId)`
    *   `openChatbotInterface(productId)`
    *   `closeInteractions()`
    *   ...and other actions for managing poetry battles.

## 5. New Files & Components

*   **Frontend UI:**
    *   `src/components/menus/llm/PlayerLlmTerminal.tsx`
    *   `src/components/menus/llm/PlayerChatbotInterface.tsx`
    *   `src/components/menus/llm/PoetryBattleViewer.tsx`
*   **Game Logic:** `src/game/systems/PoetryBattleSystem.ts`
*   **State:** `src/state/llmStore.ts`

This plan establishes a secure and extensible foundation for integrating LLM-powered features into AI Ascent.
