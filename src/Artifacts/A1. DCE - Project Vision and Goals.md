## 1. Project Vision

The vision of the Data Curation Environment (DCE) is to create a seamless, integrated toolset within VS Code that streamlines the workflow of interacting with large language models. The core problem this project solves is the manual, cumbersome process of selecting, packaging, and managing the context (code files, documents, etc.) required for effective AI-assisted development.

## 2. High-Level Goals & Phases

The project will be developed in three distinct phases.

**Note on Reference Repository:** The discovery of the `The-Creator-AI-main` repository in Cycle 2 has provided a significant head-start, especially for Phase 1 and 2. The project's focus shifts from building these components from the ground up to adapting and extending the powerful, existing foundation.

### Phase 1: The Context Chooser

The goal of this phase is to eliminate the manual management of a `files_list.txt`. Users should be able to intuitively select files and folders for their AI context directly within the VS Code file explorer UI.

-   **Core Functionality:** Implement a file explorer view with checkboxes for every file and folder.
-   **Action:** A "Flatten Context" button will take all checked items and generate a single `flattened_repo.md` file in the project root.
-   **Outcome:** A user can curate a complex context with simple mouse clicks, completely removing the need to edit a text file.
-   **Update (Cycle 2):** The reference repository contains a fully-featured `FileTree.tsx` component that already accomplishes most of this. The task is now to adapt this component and its backend `FSService` to produce the desired `flattened_repo.md` output.

### Phase 2: The Parallel Co-Pilot Panel & Cycle Navigator

This phase addresses the limitation of being locked into a single conversation with an AI assistant and introduces a way to navigate the project's history. The goal is to enable multiple, parallel interactions and to create a navigable record of the AI-driven development process.

-   **Core Functionality (Parallel Co-Pilot):** Create a custom panel within VS Code that hosts a multi-tabbed text editor. Users can manually paste different AI-generated code responses into each tab for side-by-side comparison.
-   **Key Feature ("The Switcharoo"):** A button on each tab allows the user to "swap" the content of that tab with the corresponding source file in their workspace. This provides an immediate, low-friction way to test a given AI response.
-   **Core Functionality (Cycle Navigator):** Integrate a UI element to navigate back and forth between development cycles. Each cycle will be associated with the set of AI responses generated during that cycle.
-   **Outcome:** A user can efficiently manage and test multiple AI solutions, and also review the historical evolution of the code by navigating through past cycles and their corresponding AI suggestions, creating a powerful "knowledge graph" of the project's development.

### Phase 3: The Integrated Diff Tool

This phase aims to bring a critical part of the external workflow—comparing text files—directly into the VS Code extension.

-   **Core Functionality:** Create a simple diffing utility within a VS Code webview. The user should be able to select two text sources (e.g., two AI responses from the Phase 2 panel, or a new response and an existing file) and see a visual comparison.
-   **Outcome:** Reduces the friction of copying and pasting text into external tools like WinMerge, keeping the entire curation and review workflow inside VS Code.
