# Artifact A1: DCE - Project Vision and Goals
# Date Created: Cycle 1
# Author: AI Model
# Updated on: C72 (Refine Phase 2 scope to include the Diff Tool)

## 1. Project Vision

The vision of the Data Curation Environment (DCE) is to create a seamless, integrated toolset within VS Code that streamlines the workflow of interacting with large language models. The core problem this project solves is the manual, cumbersome process of selecting, packaging, and managing the context (code files, documents, etc.) required for effective AI-assisted development.

## 2. High-Level Goals & Phases

The project will be developed in three distinct phases.

**Note on Reference Repository:** The discovery of the `The-Creator-AI-main` repository in Cycle 2 has provided a significant head-start, especially for Phase 1 and 2. The project's focus shifts from building these components from the ground up to adapting and extending the powerful, existing foundation.

### Phase 1: The Context Chooser

The goal of this phase is to eliminate the manual management of a `files_list.txt`. Users should be able to intuitively select files and folders for their AI context directly within the VS Code file explorer UI.

-   **Core Functionality:** Implement a file explorer view with checkboxes for every file and folder.
-   **Action:** A "Flatten Context" button will take all checked items and generate a single `flattened_repo.md` file in the project root.
-   **Outcome:** A user can curate a complex context with simple mouse clicks, completely removing the need to edit a text file.
-   **Status:** Largely complete.

### Phase 2: The Parallel Co-Pilot Panel & Integrated Diff Tool

This phase addresses the limitation of being locked into a single conversation with an AI assistant and brings the critical "diffing" workflow directly into the extension. The goal is to enable multiple, parallel interactions and to create a navigable record of the AI-driven development process.

-   **Core Functionality (Parallel Co-Pilot):** Create a custom panel within VS Code that hosts a multi-tabbed text editor. Users can manually paste or have the extension ingest different AI-generated code responses into each tab for side-by-side comparison.
-   **Key Feature ("Swap & Test"):** A button on each tab allows the user to "swap" the content of that tab with the corresponding source file in their workspace. This provides an immediate, low-friction way to test a given AI response.
-   **Core Functionality (Integrated Diff):** The panel will include a built-in diff viewer to compare the content of any two tabs, or a tab and the source file. This eliminates the need for external tools like WinMerge.
-   **Core Functionality (Cycle Navigator):** Integrate a UI element to navigate back and forth between development cycles. Each cycle will be associated with the set of AI responses generated during that cycle.
-   **Outcome:** A user can efficiently manage, compare, and test multiple AI solutions, and also review the historical evolution of the code by navigating through past cycles and their corresponding AI suggestions, creating a powerful "knowledge graph" of the project's development.

### Phase 3: Advanced AI & Local LLM Integration

This phase focuses on deeper integration with AI services and providing support for local models.

-   **Core Functionality:** Implement direct API calls to various LLM providers (e.g., Gemini, OpenAI, Anthropic) from within the Parallel Co-Pilot panel, populating the tabs automatically. This requires building a secure API key management system.
-   **Local LLM Support:** Allow users to configure an endpoint URL for a locally hosted LLM (e.g., via LM Studio, Ollama), enabling fully offline and private AI-assisted development.
-   **Outcome:** The DCE becomes a fully-featured AI interaction environment, supporting both cloud and local models, and automating the entire prompt-to-test workflow.
