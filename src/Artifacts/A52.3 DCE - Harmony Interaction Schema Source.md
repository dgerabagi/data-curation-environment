# Artifact A52.3: DCE - Harmony Interaction Schema Source
# Date Created: C49
# Author: AI Model & Curator

- **Key/Value for A0:**
- **Description:** The canonical source text for the M3. Interaction Schema, adapted for use with Harmony-based models like GPT-OSS. This version is injected into prompts when "Demo Mode" is active.
- **Tags:** documentation, process, interaction schema, source of truth, harmony, gpt-oss

## Interaction Schema Text

1.  Artifacts are complete, individual texts enclosed in `<xmltags>`. To ensure consistent parsing by the DCE extension, all file artifacts **must** be enclosed in `<file path="path/to/file.ts">...</file_artifact>` tags. The path must be relative to the workspace root. **The closing tag must be exactly `</file_artifact>`.** Do not use the file path in the closing tag (e.g., `</file path="...">` is incorrect). Do not write the closing tag as `</file>` or `</file_path>`. Only `</file_artifact>` will parse successfully.

2. To guarantee successful parsing, every response **must** follow this structure:
2.1.  **Summary:** Your high-level analysis and plan must be enclosed in `<summary>...</summary>` tags.
2.2.  **Course of Action:** Your point-by-point plan must be enclosed in `<course_of_action>...</course_of_action>` tags.
2.3. **New: Curator Activity Section:** If you need the human curator to perform an action that you cannot (e.g., delete a file, run a specific command), include these instructions in a dedicated `<curator_activity>...</curator_activity>` section in your response.

3.  Our Document Artifacts serve as our `Source of Truth` throughout multiple cycles. As such, over time, as issues occur, or code repeatedly regresses in the same way, seek to align our `Source of Truth` such that the Root Cause of such occurances is codified so that it can be avoided on subsequent cycles visits to those Code artifacts.

4. `flattened_repo_v2.txt` is a copy of the codebase, generated by a script; assume its an accurate representation of the existing codebase, but not necessarily a 'source of truth' like we treat our documents as, our codebase is a living artifact, documents, while we can update them, should be considered less transient.

5.  remember to output complete artifacts without placeholders, im taking your output, putting it in winmerge, and confirming we arent losing data in the update. when you provide placeholders, my cursory review turns into a meticulous file parsing, taking me from what is 5 seconds per artifact to upwards of 5 minutes, only to realize that the output is actually un-parseable, due to the nature of relativity, as the theory of relativity also applies to code. if you give me a code snippet, and do not give me the code surrounding that snippet, i do not know where that code should go. by providing the complete file, on the other hand, i can put it in a diff, see easily what was altered, and if anything was accidentally omitted or lost, i can be sure that it's retained.

6.  **Update documentation before writing code.** document artifacts are like our project readme files, our source of truth. they are our blueprints. they guide the code we write. when we realize we need to alter our approach or invent new game mechanics, we update the source of truth first, cause english is easy and flexible, then we codify that.

7. If you are deciding where to put a particular piece of code or function, and due to its nature, there are one or more candidate files that it could be placed in, choose the smaller file (in tokens).

8. basically, you should not worry about brevity, because when you go too long, your response gets interrupted by the system anyway. its better that the products you do deliver are all complete except for the last one, rather than you delivering all incomplete products, including the last one. does that make sense?

9. Each time we create a new documentation artifact, lets also create the key/value pairs needed for me to add it into our Master Artifact List. they can simply be added into the new artifact itself and ill make the new entry in A0. this will solve for me manually generating a description and tag for each new documentation artifact. also, dont place `/` in the title/name of a documentation artifact. VSCode treats it as a folder separator.

10. when creating a new documentation artifact, also just update the master artifacts list itself.
