# Artifact A10: DCE - Metadata and Statistics Display
# Date Created: Cycle 14
# Author: AI Model
# Updated on: C40 (Clarify file counter label and tooltip)

- **Key/Value for A0:**
- **Description:** Outlines the requirements and design for displaying live metadata (total selected files, total tokens) and for showing aggregate statistics (token and file counts) for folders in the file tree.
- **Tags:** feature plan, metadata, statistics, token count, ui, ux

## 1. Overview & Goal

To enhance the data curation process, it is critical for the user to have immediate, quantitative feedback on their selections. This feature will provide at-a-glance statistics at both the folder level and the overall selection level. The goal is to empower the user to make informed decisions about context size and composition without needing to perform manual calculations.

## 2. User Stories

| ID | User Story | Acceptance Criteria |
|---|---|---|
| US-01 | **Folder Statistics** | As a data curator, I want to see the total token count and the total number of files contained within each folder, so I can quickly assess the size and complexity of different parts of my project. | - Next to each folder name in the file tree, a token count is displayed. <br> - This token count is the recursive sum of all tokens from all non-image files within that folder and its subfolders. <br> - Next to the token count, a file count is also displayed, formatted with commas (e.g., "1,234"). <br> - These numbers are calculated on the backend and provided with the initial file tree data. |
| US-02 | **Live Selection Summary** | As a data curator, I want to see a live summary of my total selection as I check and uncheck files, so I can monitor the total size of my context in real-time. | - A dedicated summary panel/footer is visible in the UI. <br> - This panel displays "X files" and "Y tokens". <br> - **(C40 Update)** The label for the file count is "Selected Files". The tooltip reads: "Total number of individual files selected for flattening. This does not include empty directories." <br> - "X" is the total count of all individual files included in the current selection, formatted with commas. <br> - "Y" is the sum of all token counts for those selected non-image files. <br> - These values update instantly whenever a checkbox is changed. |
| US-03 | **Readable Numbers & Icons** | As a data curator, I want large token counts to be formatted in a compact and readable way (e.g., 1,234 becomes "1.2K"), and for icons to visually represent the data, so I can easily parse the information. | - All token counts use K/M/B suffixes for numbers over 1,000. <br> - All file counts use commas for thousands separators. <br> - An icon is displayed next to the token count and file count for visual distinction. <br> - The statistics are right-justified in the file tree for better readability. |
| US-04 | **Image File Handling** | As a data curator, I want to see the file size for images instead of a token count, so I can understand their contribution to storage/transfer size rather than context length. | - The backend identifies common image file types (png, jpg, etc.). <br> - For image files, the token count is treated as 0. <br> - In the file tree, instead of a token count, the human-readable file size is displayed (e.g., "15.2 KB", "2.1 MB"). |
| US-05 | **Selected Token Count in Folders** | As a data curator, I want to see how many tokens are selected within a folder, so I can understand the composition of my selection without expanding the entire directory. | - Next to a folder's total token count, a secondary count in parentheses `(x)` appears. <br> - `x` is the recursive sum of tokens from all selected files within that folder. <br> - The display format is `TotalTokens (SelectedTokens)`, e.g., `347K (13K)`. <br> - This count only appears if selected tokens are > 0 and less than the total tokens. |
| US-06 | **Visual Cue for Selected Tokens** | As a curator, I want a clear visual indicator on the token count itself when an item is included in the selection, so I can confirm its inclusion without looking at the checkbox. | - When an individual file is checked, its token count is wrapped in parentheses, e.g., `(168)`. <br> - When a folder is checked, and *all* of its children are included in the selection, its total token count is wrapped in parentheses, e.g., `(336)`. <br> - This complements the `Total (Selected)` format for partially selected folders. |

## 3. Technical Implementation Plan

1.  **Backend (`fs.service.ts`):**
    *   The `FileNode` interface in `src/common/types/file-node.ts` will be updated to include `isImage: boolean` and `sizeInBytes: number`.
    *   The backend service will maintain a list of image file extensions.
    *   When building the tree, it will check each file's extension.
    *   If it's an image, it will use `fs.stat` to get the `sizeInBytes`, set `isImage: true`, and set `tokenCount: 0`.
    *   If it's not an image, it will calculate the `tokenCount` and get the `sizeInBytes`.
    *   The recursive sum logic for folders will aggregate `tokenCount`, `fileCount`, and `sizeInBytes` from their children.
    *   The `vscode.workspace.findFiles` call will be updated to exclude the `node_modules` directory.

2.  **Frontend - Formatting (`formatting.ts`):**
    *   A new `formatBytes(bytes)` utility will be created to convert bytes to KB, MB, etc.
    *   A new `formatNumberWithCommas(number)` utility will be created.

3.  **Frontend - File Tree (`FileTree.tsx` & `view.scss`):**
    *   The `FileTree.tsx` component will be updated to render the new data.
    *   It will conditionally display either a formatted token count (using `formatLargeNumber`) or a formatted file size (using `formatBytes`) based on the `isImage` flag.
    *   It will display folder file counts using `formatNumberWithCommas`.
    *   **Selected Token Calculation:** A new memoized, recursive function will be created within `FileTree.tsx` to calculate the selected token count for a given directory node by checking its descendants against the `selectedFiles` prop.
    *   The rendering logic will be updated to display the `(SelectedTokens)` value conditionally.
    *   **Parenthesis Logic (US-06):** The rendering logic will be further updated. For files, it will check if the file's path is in the `selectedFiles` list. For folders, it will compare the calculated `selectedTokensInDir` with the `node.tokenCount`. Based on these checks, it will conditionally wrap the output string in parentheses.
    *   It will incorporate icons from `react-icons/vsc` for tokens and file counts.
    *   The stylesheet (`view.scss`) will be updated to right-align all statistics, pushing them to the end of the file/folder row.

4.  **Frontend - Live Summary Panel (`context-chooser.view.tsx`):**
    *   The `useMemo` hook that calculates the summary will be updated to correctly sum the total number of files and total tokens from the selected items. It will continue to ignore image sizes for the token total to avoid mixing units.
    *   The rendered output will use the new formatting utilities and icons.
    *   **(C40)** The label and title attribute will be updated for clarity.
