## 2. Task List

| ID | Task | Status (C158) | Notes |
|---|---|---|---|
| 1 | Fix adjustable vertical bar in PCPP getting stuck. | **In Progress** | Critical UI bug. Likely a stale state closure in `view.tsx` event handlers. |
| 2 | Add navigation to/from the Cycle 0 "Project Plan" view. | **In Progress** | High-impact UX. Requires UI buttons and logic changes in `view.tsx` and `OnboardingView.tsx`. |

| 5 | Fix focused tab border to highlight any active tab. | **In Progress** | CSS fix in `view.scss`. The selector is likely too specific. |
| 6 | Open `prompt.md` instead of `flattened_repo.md` after generation. | **In Progress** | Backend change in `prompt.service.ts` to call the open file service. |
| 7 | Repurpose the initial `A0` file into a valuable `README.md`. | **In Progress** | Core workflow change. Requires new `A72` artifact, and changes to `prompt.service.ts` and `history.service.ts`. |
