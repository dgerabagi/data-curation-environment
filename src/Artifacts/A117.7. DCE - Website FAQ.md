## 1. Purpose

This document provides answers to common questions about the Data Curation Environment (DCE). Its goal is to help new users understand the "why" behind the tool, its core features, and how to get the most out of its unique workflow.

## I. General & Core Concepts

### Q: What is the Data Curation Environment (DCE)?

**A:** The Data Curation Environment is a VS Code extension designed to streamline and accelerate AI-assisted development. It provides an integrated toolset for managing the context (code, documents, etc.) you provide to Large Language Models (LLMs), comparing multiple AI-generated responses in parallel, and safely testing those responses in your live workspace.

### Q: What problem does DCE solve?

**A:** DCE solves the "context problem." The quality of any AI's output is directly dependent on the quality of the input context. Manually collecting files, copying their content, and pasting them into a prompt is slow, error-prone, and inefficient. DCE automates this entire process, allowing you to curate a perfect, high-fidelity context with just a few clicks. It also solves the "single-threaded" problem of standard AI chats by allowing you to manage, compare, and test multiple AI solutions simultaneously.

### Q: Who is DCE for?

**A:** DCE is for any developer, researcher, or writer who uses LLMs as part of their workflow. It's particularly powerful for those working on complex projects who need to provide large amounts of context to an AI, and for "Citizen Architects"—individuals who orchestrate AI to build sophisticated systems.

### Q: What is "Vibecoding"?

**A:** "Vibecoding" is the intuitive, conversational process of collaborating with an AI to create something new. It starts with a high-level goal or "vibe" and progressively refines it into a functional product through a human-machine partnership. DCE is the professional toolset for serious vibecoding.

### Q: What is the "Process as Asset" philosophy?

**A:** This is the core idea that the *process* of developing with AI is as valuable as the final product. DCE captures your entire development history—your prompts, the AI's suggestions, and your decisions—as a persistent, auditable "knowledge graph." This history becomes a reusable asset for training, onboarding, and future development.

## II. Getting Started

### Q: How do I install DCE?

**A:** DCE will be available on the Visual Studio Code Marketplace. Once published, you can install it by searching for "Data Curation Environment" in the Extensions view (Ctrl+Shift+X) and clicking "Install."

### Q: How do I start a new project with DCE?

**A:** Simply open a new, empty folder in VS Code. The DCE panel will automatically open to an "Onboarding" view. Describe your project's goals in the "Project Scope" text area and click "Generate Initial Artifacts Prompt." DCE will create a `prompt.md` file and a set of starter planning documents for you.

### Q: Do I need my own API key?

**A:** No. The default "Free Mode" is a manual workflow where DCE helps you generate a `prompt.md` file that you can copy and paste into any AI chat interface you already use (like Google's AI Studio, ChatGPT, etc.). You then paste the AI's responses back into DCE for analysis.

### Q: What is "Demo Mode"?

**A:** "Demo Mode" is an included feature that connects to a local, open-source LLM running on your machine (via vLLM). It allows you to experience the full, automated workflow—sending prompts and receiving streaming responses directly within VS Code—without needing a paid API key. It's a way to demonstrate the full power of the extension.

## III. The DCE Workflow

### Q: What is the "Context Chooser"?

**A:** The Context Chooser is the file tree view with checkboxes. It's the primary interface for selecting the files and folders you want to include in your prompt. When you click "Flatten Context," it gathers all the checked files into a single `flattened_repo.md` file.

### Q: What is the "Parallel Co-Pilot Panel" (PCPP)?

**A:** The PCPP is the multi-tabbed editor where you manage AI responses. You can paste a different AI response into each tab. This allows for side-by-side comparison of different solutions to the same problem.

### Q: What does "Parse All" do?

**A:** After you paste raw AI responses into the tabs, the "Parse All" button processes them. It identifies the AI's summary, its plan, and most importantly, all the code files it generated. This transforms the raw text into a structured, interactive view.

### Q: What are "Associated Files"?

**A:** This is a list of all the files that the AI's response intends to create or modify. The DCE automatically checks if these files exist in your workspace and shows you a `✓` or `✗` next to each one, so you can immediately spot if the AI is referencing a file correctly or "hallucinating" a path.

### Q: How do I test an AI's code?

**A:** The PCPP features a "Git-Integrated Testing Workflow."
1.  **Baseline (Commit):** Creates a safe restore point of your current work.
2.  **Accept Selected:** Overwrites your local files with the AI-generated code.
3.  **Test:** You run your code to see if it works.
4.  **Restore Baseline:** If the AI's code is buggy, one click on this button instantly reverts all changes, allowing you to safely test another response.

### Q: What is a "Cycle"?

**A:** A "Cycle" represents one full loop of the development process: writing a prompt, generating responses, and accepting a solution. The DCE saves every cycle, allowing you to navigate back in time to review the exact state of the project and the AI suggestions at any point in its history.

## IV. Advanced Features

### Q: Can DCE handle files other than code?

**A:** Yes. DCE has built-in extractors for `.pdf`, `.docx`, and `.xlsx`/`.csv` files. When you check one of these files, DCE extracts its textual content on-the-fly and includes it in the context, allowing you to use documents and spreadsheets as source material for your prompts.

### Q: How does the native diff integration work?

**A:** In the "Associated Files" list, you can click the "Open Changes" button next to any file. This opens VS Code's powerful, built-in diff viewer, showing you a color-coded, side-by-side comparison of your original file and the AI's proposed changes.

### Q: Can I connect DCE to my own LLM?

**A:** Yes. In the settings, you can switch to "API (URL)" mode and provide the endpoint for any OpenAI-compatible API, such as one you host yourself with vLLM, Ollama, or another tool.

### Q: Is my data and code secure?

**A:** In "Free Mode," you are in complete control. DCE only prepares prompt files on your local machine; you decide where to send them. In "Demo Mode" or "API (URL)" mode, the extension makes direct calls from your machine to the endpoint you specify. Your code does not pass through any third-party servers controlled by the extension.
