- **Key/Value for A0:**
- **Description:** A generic template for a development and testing guide.
- **Tags:** template, cycle 0, documentation, project setup

## 1. Purpose

This guide provides the standard procedure for running, debugging, and testing the **[Your Project Name]** application locally.

## 2. Development Workflow

### Step 1: Install Dependencies

Ensure all project dependencies are installed using npm.
```bash
npm install
```

### Step 2: Start the Development Server

To compile the code and watch for changes, run the following command:```bash
npm run watch
```
This will start the development server and automatically recompile your code when you save a file.

### Step 3: Running the Application

[Describe the specific steps to launch the application. For a VS Code extension, this would involve pressing F5 to launch the Extension Development Host. For a web app, it would be opening a browser to `http://localhost:3000`.]

### Step 4: Debugging

You can set breakpoints directly in your source code. [Describe how to attach a debugger. For a VS Code extension, this is automatic when launched with F5.]

## 3. Testing

The project is configured with a testing framework. To run the test suite, use the following command:
```bash
npm run test
```
This will execute all test files located in the project and report the results to the console.
