# Date Created: C29
# Author: AI Model
# Updated on: C49 (Add user story for dragging external files into the view)

- **Key/Value for A0:**
- **Description:** Details the requirements for implementing full keyboard navigation and drag-and-drop file/folder operations within the main file tree view.
- **Tags:** feature plan, keyboard navigation, drag and drop, file operations, accessibility, ux, phase 1

## 1. Overview & Goal

To achieve true feature parity with the native VS Code Explorer and cater to power users, the Data Curation Environment must support advanced interactions. This plan outlines the requirements for two major features: full keyboard navigation for accessibility and speed, and drag-and-drop functionality for intuitive file system manipulation.

## 2. User Stories

| ID | User Story | Acceptance Criteria |
|---|---|---|
| AI-01 | **Keyboard Navigation** | As a power user, I want to navigate the file tree using only my keyboard, so I can find, select, and manage files without taking my hands off the keyboard. | - Arrow Up/Down keys move the focus between visible nodes. <br> - Arrow Right on a collapsed folder expands it. <br> - Arrow Right on an open folder or file moves focus to the first child. <br> - Arrow Left on an open folder collapses it. <br> - Arrow Left on a child node moves focus to its parent. <br> - `Enter` key opens the focused file or toggles expansion for a focused folder. <br> - `Spacebar` toggles the checkbox of the focused node. |
| AI-02 | **Internal Drag-and-Drop** | As a user, I want to be able to drag a file or folder and drop it into another folder within the DCE view to move it, so I can reorganize my project intuitively. | - Clicking and dragging a file or folder in the tree initiates a drag operation. <br> - Dragging over a folder highlights it as a potential drop target. <br> - Dropping a file/folder onto another folder moves the dragged item into the target folder. <br> - The backend file system is updated, and the tree view refreshes to reflect the new structure. |
| AI-03 | **External Drag-and-Drop** | As a user, I want to drag a file (e.g., a PDF) from my computer's file explorer and drop it into a folder in the DCE view to add it to my project, so I can quickly incorporate new assets. | - Dragging a file from the OS and dropping it onto a folder in the DCE view copies that file into the target folder in the workspace. <br> - The backend file system is updated. <br> - The file tree automatically refreshes to show the newly added file. |
| AI-04 | **Select All in Selected List** | As a user, after curating a list, I want to click in the "Selected Items" panel and press `Ctrl+A` or use a context menu to select all files in that list, so I can quickly perform a batch action like "Remove selected". | - **(C37 Update)** Right-clicking in the "Selected Items" list shows a context menu with a "Select All" option. <br> - Clicking it selects all items currently rendered in the list. <br> - The "Remove selected" button's count updates to reflect the total number of items in the list. |
| AI-05 | **Delete Key to Remove Selection** | As a user, when I have items selected in the "Selected Items" panel, I want to press the `Delete` key to remove them, so I can manage my list more quickly. | - When the "Selected Items" list has focus, pressing the `Delete` key performs the same action as clicking the "Remove selected" button. <br> - All currently selected items are removed from the overall checked files list. <br> - The local selection within the "Selected Items" panel is cleared. |

## 3. Technical Implementation Plan

### Keyboard Navigation (Completed)

The focus management and event handling for keyboard navigation are complete and stable.

### Internal Drag and Drop (Completed)

The HTML5 Drag and Drop API implementation within the React webview is complete and functional.

### External Drag and Drop (In Progress - C49)

1.  **Frontend (`view.tsx`):**
    *   Add `onDragEnter`, `onDragOver`, `onDragLeave`, and `onDrop` handlers to the main view container.
    *   The `onDrop` handler will access `event.dataTransfer.files`. It will iterate through the `FileList`, read each file as an `ArrayBuffer` using the `FileReader` API.
    *   For each file, it will send an IPC message (`RequestAddFileFromBuffer`) to the backend containing the target directory path and the file data (as a `Uint8Array`).
2.  **Backend (`fs.service.ts`):**
    *   Create a new IPC handler for `RequestAddFileFromBuffer`.
    *   This handler will receive the target path and the `Uint8Array` data.
    *   It will use `vscode.workspace.fs.writeFile(uri, buffer)` to create the new file on the file system.
    *   The existing `FileSystemWatcher` will automatically detect the new file and trigger a full UI refresh.

### Select All / Context Menu / Delete Key in Selected Items (Completed)

The context menu and keyboard shortcuts for the "Selected Items" panel are complete and functional.
