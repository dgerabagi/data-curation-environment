# Date Created: C29
# Author: AI Model
# Updated on: C61 (Document failure of URI-based drag-drop and shelve feature)

- **Key/Value for A0:**
- **Description:** Details the requirements for implementing full keyboard navigation and drag-and-drop file/folder operations within the main file tree view.
- **Tags:** feature plan, keyboard navigation, drag and drop, file operations, accessibility, ux, phase 1

## 1. Overview & Goal

To achieve true feature parity with the native VS Code Explorer and cater to power users, the Data Curation Environment must support advanced interactions. This plan outlines the requirements for two major features: full keyboard navigation for accessibility and speed, and drag-and-drop functionality for intuitive file system manipulation.

## 2. User Stories

| ID | User Story | Acceptance Criteria |
|---|---|---|
| AI-01 | **Keyboard Navigation** | As a power user, I want to navigate the file tree using only my keyboard, so I can find, select, and manage files without taking my hands off the keyboard. | - Arrow Up/Down keys move the focus between visible nodes. <br> - Arrow Right on a collapsed folder expands it. <br> - Arrow Left on an open folder collapses it. <br> - `Enter` key opens the focused file or toggles expansion. <br> - `Spacebar` toggles the checkbox of the focused node. |
| AI-02 | **Internal Drag-and-Drop** | As a user, I want to be able to drag a file or folder and drop it into another folder within the DCE view to move it, so I can reorganize my project intuitively. | - Clicking and dragging a file or folder initiates a drag operation. <br> - Dragging over a folder highlights it as a potential drop target. <br> - Dropping a file/folder onto another folder moves the dragged item. <br> - **Validation:** A folder cannot be dropped into itself or one of its own descendants. |
| AI-03 | **External Drag-and-Drop** | As a user, I want to drag a file (e.g., a PDF) from my computer's file explorer or the VS Code Explorer and drop it into a folder in the DCE view to add it to my project, so I can quickly incorporate new assets. | - Dragging a file from the OS or VS Code Explorer and dropping it onto a folder in the DCE view copies that file into the target folder in the workspace. <br> - The file tree automatically refreshes to show the newly added file. |
| AI-06 | **Hover to Expand Folder** | As a user dragging a file, when I hover over a collapsed folder for a moment, I want it to automatically expand, so I can drop the file into a nested subdirectory without having to cancel the drag operation. | - During a drag operation, hovering over a collapsed folder for ~500ms triggers its expansion. <br> - Moving the mouse away from the folder before the timer completes cancels the expansion. |

## 3. Technical Implementation Plan

### Keyboard Navigation & Internal Drag-Drop (Completed)
These features are stable and complete. The internal drag-drop includes robust validation to prevent invalid moves.

### External Drag and Drop (Shelved for Future Investigation)
This feature has proven to be highly complex due to the security model of VS Code webviews.

1.  **Problem:** When dragging a file from an external source (like the OS file explorer or the native VS Code explorer) into a webview, the `DataTransfer` object provided to the `onDrop` event is sanitized for security.
    *   **OS Drop:** Standard `event.dataTransfer.files` is available, and this works.
    *   **VS Code Explorer Drop:** `event.dataTransfer.files` is **empty**. VS Code instead provides a URI string in the `text/uri-list` data type. The webview cannot access the file system directly with this URI.

2.  **Attempted Solution (C60):** An approach was implemented to detect the `text/uri-list`, send the URI to the backend via a new IPC channel (`RequestCopyFileFromUri`), and use the `vscode.workspace.fs.copy()` API.

3.  **Result (C61):** **Failure.** Despite correctly identifying the URI and sending it to the backend, the operation failed silently. No logs were generated for the drop event itself, indicating that the webview's container may not be correctly registered as a valid drop target for this type of data transfer, or another security layer is preventing the event from firing as expected.

4.  **Path Forward:** This feature is **shelved** pending further research. The problem is non-trivial and requires a deeper understanding of VS Code's webview security and event propagation model. It is no longer an active development goal for Phase 1.
