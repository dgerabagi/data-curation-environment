- **Key/Value for A0:**
- **Description:** Details the requirements for implementing full keyboard navigation and drag-and-drop file/folder operations within the main file tree view.
- **Tags:** feature plan, keyboard navigation, drag and drop, file operations, accessibility, ux, phase 1

## 1. Overview & Goal

To achieve true feature parity with the native VS Code Explorer and cater to power users, the Data Curation Environment must support advanced interactions. This plan outlines the requirements for two major features: full keyboard navigation for accessibility and speed, and drag-and-drop functionality for intuitive file system manipulation.

## 2. User Stories

| ID | User Story | Acceptance Criteria |
|---|---|---|
| AI-01 | **Keyboard Navigation** | As a power user, I want to navigate the file tree using only my keyboard, so I can find, select, and manage files without taking my hands off the keyboard. | - Arrow Up/Down keys move the focus between visible nodes. <br> - Arrow Right on a collapsed folder expands it. <br> - Arrow Right on an open folder or file moves focus to the first child. <br> - Arrow Left on an open folder collapses it. <br> - Arrow Left on a child node moves focus to its parent. <br> - `Enter` key opens the focused file or toggles expansion for a focused folder. <br> - `Spacebar` toggles the checkbox of the focused node. |
| AI-02 | **Drag-and-Drop File Operations** | As a user, I want to be able to drag a file or folder and drop it into another folder to move it, so I can reorganize my project intuitively. | - Clicking and dragging a file or folder in the tree initiates a drag operation. <br> - Dragging over a folder highlights it as a potential drop target. <br> - Dropping a file/folder onto another folder moves the dragged item into the target folder. <br> - A confirmation dialog may be shown for destructive moves. <br> - The backend file system is updated, and the tree view refreshes to reflect the new structure. |

## 3. Technical Implementation Plan

### Keyboard Navigation

1.  **Focus Management (Frontend):**
    *   A new state variable, `focusedNodePath: string | null`, will be added to `view.tsx` to track the currently focused node.
    *   The `TreeView.tsx` component will need a wrapper `div` with a `tabIndex={0}` to make it focusable.
    *   An `onKeyDown` event handler will be attached to this wrapper.
2.  **Event Handling (`TreeView.tsx`):**
    *   The `onKeyDown` handler will contain a `switch` statement for `event.key`.
    *   It will calculate the next node to focus based on the current `focusedNodePath` and the tree structure. This requires creating a flattened, ordered list of visible nodes.
    *   It will call state update functions to change `focusedNodePath`, `expandedNodes`, or `checkedPaths` accordingly.
    *   It will call `event.preventDefault()` to stop the default browser behavior for arrow keys (scrolling).

### Drag and Drop

This is a complex feature that requires leveraging the VS Code Tree Drag and Drop API. This cannot be implemented purely in the webview; it requires a native `TreeDataProvider`. This represents a significant architectural shift from a pure webview-based tree to a hybrid approach or a full `TreeDataProvider` implementation.

1.  **Refactor to `TreeDataProvider`:**
    *   The current approach of getting all files and rendering them in React will need to be replaced.
    *   A new `DceTreeDataProvider.ts` class will be created on the **backend**.
    *   This class will implement `vscode.TreeDataProvider`, including the `getChildren`, `getTreeItem`, and `getParent` methods.
2.  **Implement Drag and Drop API:**
    *   The `DceTreeDataProvider` will also implement `vscode.TreeDragAndDropController`.
    *   The `dragMimeTypes` and `dropMimeTypes` properties will be set.
    *   The `handleDrag` method will be implemented to provide the data for the dragged items.
    *   The `handleDrop` method will be implemented to receive the dropped items and the target. This method will perform the file system move operation using `vscode.workspace.fs.rename` and then trigger a refresh of the tree data.
3.  **Communication:** The checkbox state would need to be communicated from this new native view back to the webview that contains the "Selected Items" panel, or the entire UI would need to be rebuilt using native VS Code components, which is a much larger undertaking.

**Conclusion:** Keyboard navigation is feasible within the current architecture. Drag-and-drop requires a fundamental change to using a native `TreeDataProvider` and will be a major effort for a future cycle.
