## 1. Vision & Goal

As the Data Curation Environment matures, the interaction history with the AI becomes a valuable asset in itself. Currently, this history is ephemeral, existing only within the context of a single session. The vision for the **Cycle Navigator & Knowledge Graph** is to capture this history and make it a persistent, navigable, and core feature of the development workflow.

The goal is to transform the series of AI interactions from a linear conversation into a structured, explorable history of the project's evolution. This creates a "knowledge graph" where each node is a development cycle, and the edges are the AI-generated solutions that led from one cycle to the next.

## 2. Core Concepts

1.  **Cycle-Based History:** The fundamental unit of history is the "Cycle." Every time the curator sends a prompt and receives responses, that entire transaction is associated with a unique Cycle ID (e.g., `C70`).
2.  **Persistent Response Storage:** All AI-generated responses (the content that would be pasted into the Parallel Co-Pilot tabs) are saved and tagged with their corresponding Cycle ID.
3.  **UI for Navigation:** A simple, non-intrusive UI will be added to the Parallel Co-Pilot panel, allowing the user to step backward and forward through the cycles.
4.  **Historical Context Loading:** As the user navigates to a past cycle (e.g., from `C70` to `C69`), the Parallel Co-Pilot panel will automatically load the set of AI responses that were generated during that cycle.

## 3. User Stories

| ID | User Story | Acceptance Criteria |
|---|---|---|
| P2-US-06 | **Navigate Project History** | As a developer, I want to navigate backward and forward through my project's development cycles, so I can review past decisions and the AI suggestions that prompted them. | - A UI control (e.g., left/right arrows and a cycle number display) is present in the Parallel Co-Pilot panel. <br> - Clicking the arrows changes the currently viewed cycle. |
| P2-US-07 | **View Historical Responses** | As a developer, when I navigate to a previous cycle, I want the Parallel Co-Pilot tabs to automatically populate with the AI-generated responses from that specific cycle, so I can see exactly what options I was considering at that time. | - Navigating to a cycle loads the associated set of AI responses into the tabs. <br> - The metadata (token counts, etc.) for these historical responses is also displayed. |
| P2-US-08 | **Preserve Interaction Context** | As a developer, I want every AI response to be automatically saved and associated with the current cycle, so a complete and accurate history of the project is built over time. | - A mechanism exists to automatically persist all AI responses received. <br> - Each response is tagged with a Cycle ID and a unique response UUID. |
