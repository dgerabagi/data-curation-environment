# Artifact A85: DCE - Model Card Management Plan
# Date Created: C17
# Author: AI Model & Curator

- **Key/Value for A0:**
- **Description:** A plan for an enhanced settings panel where users can create and manage "model cards" to easily switch between different LLM providers and configurations.
- **Tags:** feature plan, settings, ui, ux, llm, configuration, model management

## 1. Overview & Goal

As the DCE project evolves to support direct API integration with various Large Language Models (LLMs), users will need a flexible and intuitive way to manage their connections. The current settings panel is a good start but is not scalable for multiple providers or configurations.

The goal of this feature is to replace the simple text field in the settings panel with a "Model Card" management system. This will allow users to create, save, and select from multiple configurations for different models, whether they are cloud-based (like "AI Studio") or locally hosted.

## 2. User Stories

| ID | User Story | Acceptance Criteria |
|---|---|---|
| P2-MC-01 | **Create a New Model Card** | As a user, I want to create a new "model card" in the settings panel to configure a connection to a new LLM. | - A "Create New Model Card" button is available in the settings panel. <br> - Clicking it opens a form with fields for: Display Name, Provider (e.g., AI Studio, Local URL), API Endpoint, API Key, Context Window Size, etc. <br> - Saving the form creates a new, selectable model card. |
| P2-MC-02 | **Select Active Model** | As a user, I want to select one of my saved model cards to be the "active" model for the extension's API calls. | - The settings panel displays a list of all saved model cards. <br> - I can select one card from the list (e.g., via a radio button). <br> - The selected card's configuration is used for all subsequent AI interactions. <br> - A default, non-editable "AI Studio (Free)" card is always available. |
| P2-MC-03 | **Edit a Model Card** | As a user, I want to edit the details of a model card I previously created, so I can update an API key or endpoint URL. | - Each user-created model card has an "Edit" button. <br> - Clicking it opens the same form used for creation, pre-populated with the card's data. |
| P2-MC-04 | **Delete a Model Card** | As a user, I want to delete a model card I no longer need. | - Each user-created model card has a "Delete" button. <br> - Deleting a card prompts for confirmation and then removes it from the list. |

## 3. Proposed UI/UX

The "Settings" tab in the settings panel will be redesigned.
-   It will feature a list of existing model cards on the left.
-   The default "AI Studio (Free)" card will be present.
-   A "+" button will allow users to add new cards.
-   Selecting a card from the list will display its details in a form on the right, allowing for edits or viewing.
-   A radio button next to each card in the list will indicate which one is currently active.

## 4. Technical Implementation Plan (High-Level)

1.  **Data Storage (`settings.service.ts` - TBD):**
    *   A new backend service or an extension of the existing one will be needed to manage a list of `ModelCard` objects.
    *   This data will be stored securely in the VS Code `workspaceState` or global state. API keys within the cards will be stored using the `SecretStorage` API.

2.  **UI (`settings.view.tsx`):**
    *   The settings view will be refactored into a more complex React component that manages the list of cards and the form for editing/creating them.
    *   It will communicate with the backend service via new IPC channels to fetch, save, and delete model cards.

3.  **Integration (`LlmService.ts` - TBD):**
    *   The future `LlmService` (which will handle direct API calls) will be designed to read the currently active model card from the settings service to get the correct endpoint, key, and other parameters for its API requests.
