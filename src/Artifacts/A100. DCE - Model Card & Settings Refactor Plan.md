# Artifact A100: DCE - Model Card & Settings Refactor Plan
# Date Created: C62
# Author: AI Model & Curator

- **Key/Value for A0:**
- **Description:** A plan to implement a user-configurable "Model Card" system in the settings panel. This includes a UI for managing different LLM configurations and a feature to query a vLLM server's `/v1/models` endpoint to auto-populate model details.
- **Tags:** feature plan, settings, ui, ux, llm, configuration, model management

## 1. Vision & Goal

To enhance the flexibility of the DCE, users need a more sophisticated way to manage connections to different LLMs. The current mode-switching UI is a good start, but a "Model Card" system will provide a more powerful and user-friendly experience, allowing users to save, edit, and switch between multiple, named configurations for various local or remote models.

The goal is to refactor the settings panel to support a CRUD (Create, Read, Update, Delete) interface for these model cards and to add a feature that can query a vLLM endpoint to auto-populate model information, simplifying setup.

## 2. User Stories

| ID | User Story | Acceptance Criteria |
|---|---|---|
| P3-MC-01 | **Create a Model Card** | As a user, I want to create a new "model card" where I can input all the necessary information to connect to an LLM, so I can configure different models for different tasks. | - A "New Model Card" button exists in the Settings Panel. <br> - Clicking it opens a form with fields for: Display Name, API Endpoint URL, API Key (optional), Context Window Size, and Reasoning Level. <br> - A "Save" button persists this card. |
| P3-MC-02 | **Manage Model Cards** | As a user, I want to see a list of my saved model cards and be able to edit or delete them, so I can manage my configurations. | - The Settings Panel displays a list of all saved model cards. <br> - Each card in the list has "Edit" and "Delete" buttons. |
| P3-MC-03 | **Select Active Model** | As a user, I want to select one of my model cards as the "active" model from a dropdown list, so the extension knows which LLM to use for its API calls. | - A dropdown menu in the settings panel lists all saved model cards by their display name. <br> - The currently active model is shown in the dropdown. <br> - Selecting a new model from the dropdown sets it as the active configuration. |
| P3-MC-04 | **Auto-Populate vLLM Info** | As a user configuring a vLLM endpoint, I want a button to automatically fetch the model's details (like its name and context window), so I don't have to look them up manually. | - In the model card creation form, next to the API Endpoint URL field, there is a "Query" or "Fetch Info" button. <br> - Clicking it sends a request to the `/v1/models` endpoint of the provided URL. <br> - If successful, the model name and max context length are parsed from the response and used to populate the form fields. |

## 3. Technical Implementation Plan

1.  **Data Storage (`settings.service.ts`):**
    *   The settings service will be updated to manage a list of `ModelCard` objects and the ID of the `activeModelCard`.
    *   API keys will continue to be stored securely in `SecretStorage`, associated with a unique ID for each model card.

2.  **Backend (`llm.service.ts`):**
    *   A new method, `getModelInfo(endpointUrl: string)`, will be created. It will make a `GET` request to the `${endpointUrl}/models` endpoint.
    *   It will parse the JSON response to extract the model ID and maximum context length (`max_model_len`).
    *   This will be exposed via a new `RequestModelInfo` IPC channel.

3.  **Settings Panel UI Refactor (`settings.view.tsx`):**
    *   The current radio-button UI will be replaced with the new Model Card management UI.
    *   A dropdown will display all saved `ModelCard` names and manage the `activeModelCard` state.
    *   A list view will display the cards with "Edit" and "Delete" buttons.
    *   A modal or separate view will be used for the "Create/Edit Model Card" form.
    *   The form will include the new "Query" button, which will trigger the `RequestModelInfo` IPC message and update the form's state with the response.

4.  **Integration (`llm.service.ts`):**
    *   The main `generateBatch` and `generateSingle` methods will be updated. Instead of a `switch` on the `connectionMode`, they will now fetch the `activeModelCard` from the `SettingsService` and use its properties (URL, key, reasoning level) to construct the API request.
