# Artifact A81: DCE - Curator Activity Plan
# Date Created: C6
# Author: AI Model & Curator

- **Key/Value for A0:**
- **Description:** A plan to introduce a new `<curator_activity>` section to the AI response format, allowing for explicit instructions to the human curator.
- **Tags:** documentation, process, interaction schema, workflow

## 1. Overview & Goal

Currently, if the AI needs the human curator to perform an action it cannot (e.g., delete a file, install a dependency), it must embed this instruction within the "Course of Action" or summary. This can be missed and is not machine-parsable.

The goal of this feature is to create a formal, dedicated channel for these instructions. A new `<curator_activity>...</curator_activity>` section will be added to the interaction schema. The extension will parse this section and display it in a distinct, highly visible area of the UI, ensuring the curator sees and can act upon these critical instructions.

## 2. User Story

| ID | User Story | Acceptance Criteria |
|---|---|---|
| P2-CA-01 | **Receive Curator Instructions** | As a curator, when an AI response includes actions I need to perform manually, I want to see them clearly separated from the AI's own course of action, so I don't miss them. | - The AI can include a `<curator_activity>` block in its response. <br> - The PCPP parser extracts the content of this block. <br> - The UI displays this content in a new, clearly labeled "Curator Activity" collapsible section. |

## 3. Technical Implementation Plan

1.  **Update Interaction Schema:**
    *   **`A52.2 DCE - Interaction Schema Source.md`:** A new rule will be added, defining the `<curator_activity>...</curator_activity>` section and explaining its purpose to the AI.

2.  **Update Parser (`response-parser.ts`):**
    *   A new `CURATOR_ACTIVITY_REGEX` will be added to extract the content from the new tags.
    *   The `ParsedResponse` interface in `pcpp.types.ts` will be updated with a new optional property, `curatorActivity?: string`.

3.  **Update UI (`ParsedView.tsx`):**
    *   A new `CollapsibleSection` will be added to the parsed view.
    *   It will be titled "Curator Activity".
    *   It will be conditionally rendered only if `parsedContent.curatorActivity` exists and is not empty.
    *   The content will be rendered as formatted Markdown.
