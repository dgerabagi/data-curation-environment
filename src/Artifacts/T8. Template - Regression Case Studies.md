# Artifact T8: Template - Regression Case Studies
# Date Created: C141
# Author: AI Model & Curator

- **Key/Value for A0:**
- **Description:** A generic template for a regression case studies document, promoting development best practices.
- **Tags:** template, cycle 0, documentation, project setup

## 1. Purpose

This document serves as a living record of persistent or complex bugs that have recurred during development. By documenting the root cause analysis (RCA) and the confirmed solution for each issue, we create a "source of truth" that can be referenced to prevent the same mistakes from being reintroduced into the codebase.

## 2. Case Studies

---

### Case Study 001: [Name of the Bug]

-   **Artifacts Affected:** [List of files, e.g., `src/components/MyComponent.tsx`, `src/services/api.service.ts`]
-   **Cycles Observed:** [e.g., C10, C15]
-   **Symptom:** [Describe what the user sees. e.g., "When a user clicks the 'Save' button, the application crashes silently."]
-   **Root Cause Analysis (RCA):** [Describe the underlying technical reason for the bug. e.g., "The API service was not correctly handling a null response from the server. A race condition occurred where the UI component would unmount before the API promise resolved, leading to a state update on an unmounted component."]
-   **Codified Solution & Best Practice:**
    1.  [Describe the specific code change, e.g., "The API service was updated to always return a default object instead of null."]
    2.  [Describe the pattern or best practice to follow, e.g., "All API calls made within a React component's `useEffect` hook must include a cleanup function to cancel the request or ignore the result if the component unmounts."]
