- **Key/Value for A0:**
- **Description:** A plan for a new settings panel, accessible via a help icon, to house changelogs, settings, and other informational content.
- **Tags:** feature plan, settings, ui, ux, changelog

## 1. Overview & Goal

As the Data Curation Environment (DCE) grows in features, users will need a centralized location to manage settings, view changelogs, and access help documentation. The goal of this feature is to create a dedicated "Settings" or "Help" panel, accessible via a new icon in the Parallel Co-Pilot Panel (PCPP), that serves as this central hub.

**Status (C12):** In Progress.

## 2. User Stories

| ID | User Story | Acceptance Criteria |
|---|---|---|
| P2-SET-01 | **Access Help and Settings** | As a user, I want to click a help icon (`?`) in the PCPP to open a dedicated panel, so I can access settings and information about the extension. | - A help icon is present in the main header of the PCPP. <br> - Clicking it opens a new `WebviewPanel` in the main editor area, titled "DCE Settings & Help". |
| P2-SET-02 | **View Changelog** | As a user, I want to view a changelog within the settings panel, so I can see what has changed in the latest version of the extension. | - The settings panel has a "Changelog" tab. <br> - This tab displays the content of a `CHANGELOG.md` file, rendered as formatted Markdown. |
| P2-SET-03 | **Manage Settings** | As a user, I want to manage extension settings from this panel, so I can configure features to my preference. | - The settings panel has a "Settings" tab. <br> - It provides UI controls for managing settings, such as API keys (from `A41`), exclusion list patterns (from `A82`), and other configurable options. |

## 3. Technical Implementation Plan

1.  **New Command & Icon:**
    *   **UI (`view.tsx`):** Add a new help/question mark icon button to the main header of the PCPP.
    *   **Command (`commands.ts`):** The button will trigger a new command, `dce.openSettingsPanel`.
    *   **`extension.ts`:** The command handler will create and manage a singleton `WebviewPanel`, similar to how the PCPP itself is managed.

2.  **New Settings Webview:**
    *   A new view will be created under `src/client/views/settings.view/`.
    *   It will have its own `view.tsx`, `view.scss`, `on-message.ts`, etc.
    *   The `view.tsx` will render a tabbed interface ("Settings", "Changelog", "About").

3.  **Backend Logic:**
    *   **Changelog:** The backend will have a service that reads the `CHANGELOG.md` file from the extension's root directory and sends its content to the settings webview to be rendered.
    *   **Settings:** The backend will need a new `SettingsService` that interacts with `vscode.workspace.getConfiguration()` to get and set both global and workspace-level settings for the extension. This will be the backend for the UI controls in the settings tab.
