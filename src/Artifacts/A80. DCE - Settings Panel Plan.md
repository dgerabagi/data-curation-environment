- **Key/Value for A0:**
- **Description:** A plan for a new settings panel, accessible via a help icon, to house changelogs, settings, and other informational content.
- **Tags:** feature plan, settings, ui, ux, changelog

## 1. Overview & Goal

As the Data Curation Environment (DCE) grows in features, users will need a centralized location to manage settings, view changelogs, and access help documentation. The goal of this feature is to create a dedicated "Settings & Help" panel, accessible via a new `?` icon in the Parallel Co-Pilot Panel (PCPP), that serves as this central hub.

**Status (C15):** In Progress.

## 2. User Stories

| ID | User Story | Acceptance Criteria |
|---|---|---|
| P2-SET-01 | **Access Help and Settings** | As a user, I want to click a help icon (`?`) in the PCPP to open a dedicated panel, so I can access settings and information about the extension. | - A help icon is present in the main header of the PCPP. <br> - Clicking it opens a new `WebviewPanel` in the main editor area, titled "DCE Settings & Help". |
| P2-SET-02 | **View Changelog** | As a user, I want to view a changelog within the settings panel, so I can see what has changed in the latest version of the extension. | - The settings panel has a "Changelog" tab. <br> - This tab displays the content of a `CHANGELOG.md` file from the workspace root, rendered as formatted Markdown. |
| P2-SET-03 | **View About/README** | As a user, I want to view an "About" page that explains the purpose and workflow of the DCE, so I can get help on how to use it. | - The settings panel has an "About" tab. <br> - This tab displays the content of the `README.md` file from the workspace root. |
| P2-SET-04 | **Manage Settings (Future)** | As a user, I want to manage extension settings from this panel, so I can configure features to my preference. | - The settings panel has a "Settings" tab. <br> - It provides UI controls for managing settings, such as API keys (from `A41`) and the future URL-based LLM endpoint. |

## 3. Technical Implementation Plan

1.  **New Command & Icon:**
    *   **UI (`view.tsx`):** A help/question mark icon button in the main header of the PCPP triggers the `dce.openSettingsPanel` command.
    *   **Command (`commands.ts`):** The command executes an internal `dce.showSettingsPanel` command to follow our established architectural pattern.
    *   **`extension.ts`:** The handler for `dce.showSettingsPanel` creates and manages a singleton `WebviewPanel`, ensuring only one settings panel can exist.

2.  **New Settings Webview:**
    *   A new view will be created under `src/client/views/settings.view/`.
    *   `view.tsx` will render a simple tabbed interface ("Changelog", "About").
    *   On mount, it will send IPC messages to the backend to request the content for the `CHANGELOG.md` and `README.md` files.

3.  **Backend Logic:**
    *   **`file-operation.service.ts`:** New handlers (`handleChangelogContentRequest`, `handleReadmeContentRequest`) will be added to read the respective files from the workspace root and send their content back to the settings webview.
    *   **IPC:** New channels (`RequestChangelogContent`, `SendChangelogContent`, etc.) will be added to facilitate this communication.
