# Artifact A8: DCE - Phase 1 - Selection Sets Feature Plan
# Date Created: Cycle 11
# Author: AI Model
# Updated on: C23 (Add requirement for selection persistence)

- **Key/Value for A0:**
- **Description:** A plan outlining the user stories, UI/UX, and technical implementation for saving, loading, and persisting different sets of selected files (selection profiles).
- **Tags:** feature plan, selection sets, profiles, context management, persistence, phase 1

## 1. Overview & Goal

The goal of the "Selection Sets" feature is to address the user feedback regarding the need to save and switch between different file selections, and to ensure the current selection is not lost during a session. Users often work on multiple tasks or projects concurrently, each requiring a different context. Manually re-selecting files is tedious and losing the current selection when switching tabs is a critical usability flaw. This feature will allow users to save a named "set" of their current selections, quickly load it back later, and have their current selection state persist automatically.

## 2. User Stories

| ID | User Story | Acceptance Criteria |
|---|---|---|
| US-01 | **Selection Persistence** | As a user, I expect my current selection of checked files to remain active when I switch to another VS Code tab and then return, so my work is not lost. | - The current array of selected file paths is automatically saved to the webview's persistent state whenever it changes. <br> - When the webview is re-activated (e.g., tab is clicked), it restores the last saved selection state. |
| US-02 | **Save Current Selection** | As a developer, I want to save my currently checked files as a named set, so I don't have to re-select them manually when I switch tasks. | - A UI element (e.g., button or menu item) exists to "Save current selection". <br> - Clicking it prompts me to enter a name for the selection set. <br> - After providing a name, the current list of selected file paths is saved. <br> - I receive a confirmation that the set was saved. |
| US-03 | **Load a Saved Selection** | As a developer, I want to load a previously saved selection set, so I can quickly restore a specific context. | - A UI element (e.g., a dropdown menu) lists all saved selection sets by name. <br> - Selecting a set from the list immediately updates the file tree, checking all the files and folders from that set. <br> - Any previously checked files that are not part of the loaded set become unchecked. |
| US-04 | **Delete a Saved Selection** | As a developer, I want to delete a selection set that I no longer need, so I can keep my list of saved sets clean. | - A UI element exists to manage or delete saved sets. <br> - I can select a set to delete from a list. <br> - I am asked to confirm the deletion. <br> - Upon confirmation, the set is removed from the list of saved sets. |

## 3. Proposed UI/UX

The functionality will be consolidated into the `view-header` of our Context Chooser panel for easy access.

1.  **Header Controls:**
    *   A dropdown menu and/or a set of dedicated toolbar buttons for managing selection sets.
    *   Example: A "Save" icon button and a "Load" icon button.
    *   Clicking "Save" would trigger the save workflow.
    *   Clicking "Load" would open a Quick Pick menu of saved sets.

2.  **Saving a Set:**
    *   Clicking the "Save" button will execute the `dce.saveSelectionSet` command.
    *   This command will trigger a VS Code input box (`vscode.window.showInputBox`).
    *   The user will enter a name (e.g., "API Feature", "Frontend Refactor").
    *   On submission, the backend saves the current `selectedFiles` array under that name.

3.  **Loading a Set:**
    *   Clicking the "Load" button will execute the `dce.loadSelectionSet` command.
    *   This command shows a Quick Pick list (`vscode.window.showQuickPick`) of all saved sets.
    *   Selecting a set triggers an IPC message (`ApplySelectionSet`) to the frontend with the array of file paths for that set.
    *   The frontend updates its `selectedFiles` state, causing the tree to re-render with the new selections.

## 4. Technical Implementation Plan

1.  **State Persistence (`view.tsx`):**
    *   Define a state type in `vscode-webview.d.ts`: `interface ViewState { selectedFiles: string[] }`.
    *   In the main `App` component in `view.tsx`, use a `useEffect` hook that triggers whenever the `selectedFiles` state changes. Inside this effect, call `vscode.setState({ selectedFiles })`.
    *   On initial component mount, retrieve the persisted state using `const savedState = vscode.getState();` and if it exists, use it to initialize the `selectedFiles` state: `useState<string[]>(savedState?.selectedFiles || [])`.

2.  **Data Storage (`selection.service.ts`):**
    *   Selection sets will continue to be stored in the VS Code `workspaceState`. This is a key-value store specific to the current workspace.
    *   A single key, e.g., `dce.selectionSets`, will hold an object where keys are the set names and values are the `string[]` of absolute file paths.

3.  **IPC Channels & Commands (`commands.ts`):**
    *   The existing commands (`dce.saveSelectionSet`, `dce.loadSelectionSet`, `dce.deleteSelectionSet`) are suitable.
    *   The backend `loadSelectionSet` command will trigger the `ApplySelectionSet` IPC message to the client with the file paths.

4.  **Frontend Logic (`view.tsx`):**
    *   Add state to store the map of selection sets: `const [selectionSets, setSelectionSets] = useState({});`
    *   On mount, request the list of sets from the backend to populate any UI elements.
    *   Implement an effect to listen for `ApplySelectionSet` and call `setSelectedFiles()` with the new paths.
    *   Render the new "Save" and "Load" buttons in the header toolbar.
    *   The `onClick` handler for the "Save" button will trigger an IPC message that executes the `dce.saveSelectionSet` command, passing the current `selectedFiles` state.
