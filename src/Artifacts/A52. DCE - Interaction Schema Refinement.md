- **Key/Value for A0:**
- **Description:** A set of refined rules and an explanation of the parsing logic for the AI's output format to improve the reliability and consistency of automated parsing within the Parallel Co-Pilot Panel.
- **Tags:** documentation, process, parsing, interaction schema, metainterpretability

## 1. Overview & Goal

The Parallel Co-Pilot Panel (PCPP) relies on parsing your output to provide features like file association, diffing, and syntax highlighting. To ensure this process is reliable, your responses must adhere to a strict and consistent format.

The goal of this document is to serve as a definitive guide for you, the AI, on how to structure your responses. It explains the "documentation first" principle we follow and details the exact logic the PCPP parser uses. By understanding how you are being interpreted, you can generate perfectly parsable output every time.

## 2. The "Documentation First" Principle

A core principle of this project is to **plan before coding**.
-   **Cycle 0 (Project Initialization):** Your first task for a new project is **always** to generate planning and documentation artifacts (e.g., A1 Project Vision, A2 Requirements), not code files. You should use the provided templates as a guide.
-   **Subsequent Cycles:** When a new feature is requested, your first step should be to update existing documentation or create new artifacts that describe the plan for that feature. You should only generate code *after* the plan has been documented.

## 3. How the PCPP Parser Works

The parser is designed to be simple and robust. It looks for specific tags to break your response into structured data.

### Step 1: Extract Summary / Plan
-   **Rule:** Your high-level summary, thoughts, or plan must be enclosed in `<summary>...</summary>` tags.
-   **Parser Logic:** The parser captures all text between the opening and closing `summary` tags.

### Step 2: Extract Course of Action
-   **Rule:** Your point-by-point plan must be enclosed in `<course_of_action>...</course_of_action>` tags.
-   **Parser Logic:** The parser captures all text between the opening and closing `course_of_action` tags.

### Step 3: Extract File Blocks
The parser's most important job is to find and extract all file blocks.
-   **Rule:** Every file you generate **must** be enclosed in `<file path="..."></file>` tags.
-   **Example:**
    ```xml
    <file path="src/main.ts">
    // ... content of main.ts
    </file>
    ```
-   **Parser Logic:** The parser looks for the literal string `<file path="` followed by a quoted path, then captures everything until it finds the literal closing string `</file>`. **Any other format will be ignored.**

## 4. Canonical Response Structure

To guarantee successful parsing, every response should follow this structure:

```
<summary>
[High-level summary and analysis of the request.]
</summary>

<course_of_action>
1.  [A detailed, point-by-point plan of the changes you are about to make.]
2.  [Another point in the plan.]
</course_of_action>

<file path="path/to/first/file.ts">
// Full content of the first file...
</file>

<file path="path/to/second/file.md">
# Full content of the second file...
</file>
```
