# Artifact A105: DCE - PCPP View Refactoring Plan for Cycle 76
# Date Created: C76
# Author: AI Model & Curator
# Updated on: C86 (Complete rewrite of refactoring strategy)

## 1. Problem Statement & Acknowledgment of Prior Failures

The `parallel-copilot.view/view.tsx` component has grown to over 10,000 tokens, making it a "god component." It manages state and renders logic for numerous distinct features, making it difficult to maintain, prone to bugs, and inefficient to include in AI prompts.

Previous refactoring attempts in Cycles 82-85 were ineffective. They failed to significantly reduce the component's size because they only shuffled logic between `view.tsx` and other *existing* presentational components. They did not address the core problem: the monolithic concentration of business logic and state management within the `view.tsx` file itself.

This document presents a new, fundamentally different refactoring strategy that will resolve this issue by extracting logic into **new files** as custom React hooks.

## 2. The New Refactoring Strategy: Container/Hooks/Presentational

The new plan is to refactor `view.tsx` using a standard, robust React pattern for managing complexity: **Container/Hooks/Presentational**.

1.  **Container (`view.tsx`):** The `view.tsx` file will become a lean "container" component. Its sole responsibility will be to orchestrate the application. It will call the various custom hooks to get the state and logic handlers it needs, and then pass that data down as props to the presentational components.
2.  **Hooks (`/hooks/*.ts`):** All complex business logic, state management (`useState`, `useMemo`, `useEffect`), and IPC handling will be extracted from `view.tsx` and moved into a series of new, single-responsibility custom hooks. These are new files that will live in a new `src/client/views/parallel-copilot.view/hooks/` directory.
3.  **Presentational (`/components/*.tsx`):** The existing components (`CycleNavigator`, `ResponseTabs`, `ParsedView`, etc.) will remain as "dumb" presentational components. They will receive all the data they need to render and all the functions they need to call via props.

## 3. Proposed New Files: Custom Hooks

A new directory will be created: `src/client/views/parallel-copilot.view/hooks/`. The following new files will be created within it, each containing a custom hook to manage a specific domain of logic.

| New File | Hook Name | Responsibility | Estimated Tokens |
| :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- |
| `usePcppIpc.ts` | `usePcppIpc` | Encapsulates the massive `useEffect` that registers all `clientIpc.onServerMessage` listeners. It will take state-setter functions as arguments and call them when messages are received. | ~2,000 |
| `useCycleManagement.ts` | `useCycleManagement` | Manages `currentCycle`, `maxCycle`, `cycleTitle`, `cycleContext`, `ephemeralContext`, `saveStatus`. Exposes handlers like `handleCycleChange`, `handleNewCycle`, `saveCurrentCycleState`. | ~1,500 |
| `useTabManagement.ts` | `useTabManagement` | Manages `tabs`, `activeTab`, `tabCount`, `isParsedMode`, `isSortedByTokens`. Exposes handlers like `handleTabSelect`, `handleRawContentChange`, `parseAllTabs`, `handleSortToggle`. | ~1,800 |
| `useFileManagement.ts` | `useFileManagement` | Manages `selectedFilePath`, `selectedFilesForReplacement`, `fileExistenceMap`, `pathOverrides`, `comparisonMetrics`. Exposes handlers like `handleSelectForViewing`, `handleAcceptSelectedFiles`, `handleLinkFile`. | ~2,000 |
| `useWorkflow.ts` | `useWorkflow` | Manages the `workflowStep` state and contains the complex `useEffect` logic that determines the next step in the guided workflow. | ~1,200 |
| `useGeneration.ts` | `useGeneration` | Manages `generationProgress`, `tps`, `isGenerationComplete`, `connectionMode`. Exposes handlers like `handleGenerateResponses`, `handleStartGeneration`, `handleRegenerateTab`. | ~1,000 |

### 3.1. Revised Token Distribution Estimate

| Component | Responsibility | New Estimated Tokens |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **`view.tsx` (Container)** | - Call all custom hooks. <br> - Render top-level conditional UI (`Onboarding`, `Progress`, `Main`). <br> - Pass props to presentational components. | **~1,500** |
| **New Hooks Total** | - All business logic and state management. | **~9,500** |
| **Existing Components** | - UI Rendering. | (Unchanged) |

This architecture will reduce `view.tsx` from **~10,300 tokens** to a much more manageable **~1,500 tokens**.

## 4. Implementation Steps (For Next Cycle)

1.  **Create `hooks` directory and files:** Create the new directory and the empty hook files listed above.
2.  **Migrate Logic to Hooks:** Systematically move related `useState`, `useCallback`, `useMemo`, and `useEffect` blocks from `view.tsx` into the appropriate new custom hook file. Each hook will return an object containing the state values and handler functions it manages.
3.  **Refactor `view.tsx`:**
    *   Remove all the logic that was moved to the hooks.
    *   Call each new custom hook at the top of the `App` component.
    *   Update the props being passed to the child presentational components (`CycleNavigator`, `ContextInputs`, etc.) to use the state and handlers returned from the hooks.
4.  **Verification:** Test the UI thoroughly to ensure that all functionality remains intact after the refactor.
