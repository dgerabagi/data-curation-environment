# Artifact A32: DCE - Phase 1 - Excel and CSV Handling Strategy
# Date Created: C62
# Author: AI Model
# Updated on: C67 (Revert to xlsx and custom Markdown converter for stability)

- **Key/Value for A0:**
- **Description:** Defines the strategy for handling tabular data files (.xlsx, .xls, .csv) by converting them to Markdown tables on-demand and caching them in memory for flattening.
- **Tags:** feature plan, excel, csv, text extraction, virtualization, cache, phase 1

## 1. Overview & Goal

Following the successful implementation of PDF virtualization, users now require a similar capability for tabular data files, specifically Microsoft Excel (`.xlsx`, `.xls`) and Comma-Separated Values (`.csv`). The goal is to extract the content from these files and represent it as clean, readable Markdown tables within the flattened context. This will be achieved using the same on-demand, in-memory caching strategy to avoid creating temporary files in the user's workspace.

## 2. User Stories

| ID | User Story | Acceptance Criteria |
|---|---|---|
| XLS-01 | **Include Tabular Data in Context** | As a user, when I check an Excel or CSV file, I want its data to be converted to Markdown tables and included in the `flattened_repo.md`, so I can use structured data as context for the LLM. | - Checking `.xlsx`, `.xls`, and `.csv` files is allowed. <br> - The token count displayed for the file reflects its Markdown table content. <br> - When flattened, the content is included within a `<file>` tag. <br> - For Excel files with multiple sheets, each sheet is converted to a separate named Markdown table. <br> - No temporary `.md` files are created in the user's workspace. |

## 3. Technical Implementation Plan (C67 Update)

1.  **Dependency:**
    *   After encountering critical parsing bugs and format limitations with `exceljs`, the project has reverted to using the more robust **`xlsx` (SheetJS)** library. This will be the sole dependency for parsing tabular data.
    *   **Vulnerability Note:** The `xlsx` package has a known high-severity vulnerability. While a direct fix from the library maintainers is not yet available, our implementation mitigates risk by using it only for its core data parsing and implementing our own logic for converting that data to Markdown, rather than using the library's more complex and less-audited utility functions.

2.  **Backend (`fs.service.ts`):**
    *   **In-Memory Cache:** A private cache will be maintained: `private excelMarkdownCache = new Map<string, { markdown: string; tokenCount: number }>();`.
    *   **IPC Handler (`RequestExcelToText`):**
        *   This handler will receive a file path. It will first check the cache.
        *   If not cached, it will read the file buffer.
        *   It will use `XLSX.read(buffer)` to parse the file into a workbook object. This works for `.xlsx`, `.xls`, and `.csv`.
        *   It will iterate through each sheet name in the `workbook.SheetNames`.
        *   For each sheet, it will call a **custom private helper method, `_sheetToMarkdown`**.
    *   **Custom Markdown Converter (`_sheetToMarkdown`):**
        *   This new function will take a worksheet object from `xlsx` as input.
        *   It will use `XLSX.utils.sheet_to_json(worksheet, { header: 1 })` to get an array-of-arrays representation of the sheet.
        *   It will then manually iterate over these arrays to construct a Markdown table string, creating the header row (`| Col1 | Col2 |`), the separator line (`|---|---|`), and all data rows.
        *   This custom implementation provides stability and avoids potential bundling issues with the library's own `sheet_to_markdown` utility.
        *   The final Markdown string (including headers for each sheet) will be concatenated, its token count calculated, and the result stored in the cache.
        *   It will then send an `UpdateNodeStats` message back to the client with the new token count.

3.  **Frontend & Flattener Integration:**
    *   The frontend (`view.tsx`) will continue to trigger the `RequestExcelToText` message on-demand.
    *   The backend (`flattener.service.ts`) will continue to retrieve the virtual Markdown content from the `FSService`'s cache. No changes are needed in these files.
