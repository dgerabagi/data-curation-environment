# Artifact A18: DCE - Phase 1 - Active File Sync Feature Plan
# Date Created: Cycle 24
# Author: AI Model
# Updated on: C44 (Add logic for suppressing auto-reveal after file operations)

- **Key/Value for A0:**
- **Description:** Details the requirements and implementation for automatically revealing and highlighting the active editor's file in the custom Data Curation file tree.
- **Tags:** feature plan, active file, sync, reveal, tree view, ux, phase 1

## 1. Overview & Goal

To create a more seamless and integrated experience, the Data Curation Environment's file tree should stay in sync with the user's focus in the main editor. Currently, selecting a file in the editor does not reflect in our custom view. The goal of this feature is to replicate the behavior of the native VS Code Explorer, where the active file is automatically revealed and highlighted in the file tree.

## 2. User Story

| ID | User Story | Acceptance Criteria |
|---|---|---|
| UX-01 | **Sync with Active Editor** | As a user, when I click on a file in the VS Code editor tabs or the native Explorer, I want the "Data Curation" file tree to automatically scroll to and highlight that file, so I can easily see its location in the project hierarchy and interact with its checkbox without manually searching for it. | - When the active text editor changes in VS Code, the new file is highlighted in the "Data Curation" tree view. <br> - All parent folders of the active file are automatically expanded to ensure it is visible. <br> - The file tree view scrolls so that the active file item is visible on the screen. |
| UX-02 | **Preserve View State** | As a user, after I perform an action that collapses the tree (e.g., "Collapse All") and then perform a file operation (e.g., drag-and-drop), I do not want the tree to automatically re-expand to reveal the active file, so my intended view state is respected. | - After a file operation (move, delete, rename, new file) triggers a refresh, the "Sync with Active Editor" feature is temporarily suppressed for the next event. <br> - This prevents the tree from re-expanding against the user's will. |

## 3. Technical Implementation Plan

1.  **Backend Listener (`extension.ts`):**
    *   Utilize the `vscode.window.onDidChangeActiveTextEditor` event listener in the `activate` function.
    *   This event provides the `TextEditor` object, from which `editor.document.uri.fsPath` can be extracted.
    *   When the event fires and an editor is present, the backend will normalize the file path (to use forward slashes) and send an IPC message to the webview containing the active file's path.

2.  **IPC Channel:**
    *   The existing `ServerToClientChannel.SetActiveFile` will be used.
    *   **(C44 Update)** The `ServerToClientChannel.ForceRefresh` channel's payload is updated from `{}` to `{ reason?: 'fileOp' | 'manual' }`.

3.  **Frontend View Logic (`TreeView.tsx`):**
    *   A `useEffect` hook in the `TreeView` component triggers whenever the `activeFile` prop changes.
    *   This effect is responsible for "revealing" the file by calculating all parent directory paths, adding them to the `expandedNodes` state, and then calling `scrollIntoView()` on the file's element ref.

4.  **Auto-Reveal Suppression Logic (C44):**
    *   **Backend (`fs.service.ts`):** The file watcher, upon detecting a change, will now send the `ForceRefresh` message with a payload: `{ reason: 'fileOp' }`.
    *   **Frontend (`view.tsx`):**
        *   A `useRef` flag (`suppressActiveFileReveal`) is used to track the suppression state.
        *   The message handler for `ForceRefresh` checks for the `fileOp` reason and sets the suppression flag to `true`, with a timeout to reset it.
        *   The message handler for `SetActiveFile` checks the flag. If `true`, it ignores the event, resets the flag, and prevents the `activeFile` state from being updated, thus preventing the reveal.

## 5. Debugging Notes & Regression Prevention

-   **Root Cause of C30 Regression:** The feature failed because of a path normalization mismatch. The `editor.document.uri.fsPath` property from the VS Code API returns paths with **backslashes (`\`)** on Windows. The frontend webview components, however, exclusively use and expect **forward slashes (`/`)** for path comparisons and manipulations.
-   **Codified Solution:** The path from the `onDidChangeActiveTextEditor` event **must** be normalized to use forward slashes *before* it is sent to the frontend via the IPC channel.
