- **Key/Value for A0:**
- **Description:** Details the plan for a "Generate prompt.md" button that will assemble the static schemas, cycle history, and flattened code into a single, complete prompt file.

## 1. Overview & Goal

The process of constructing the final `prompt.md` file is a core part of the curator's workflow. It involves manually assembling several distinct pieces of content: static schemas, the cycle history, and the dynamically generated `flattened_repo.md`. This is a repetitive and error-prone task. The goal of this feature is to automate this process with a single button click, generating a complete, perfectly formatted `prompt.md` file on demand.

## 2. User Story

| ID | User Story | Acceptance Criteria |
|---|---|---|
| P2-PROMPT-01 | **Generate Complete Prompt** | As a curator, I want to click a button to generate a complete `prompt.md` file that includes all my standard schemas, the project's cycle history, and the latest flattened code, so I can start my next development cycle with zero manual setup. | - A "Generate `prompt.md`" button is available in the Parallel Co-Pilot Panel UI. <br> - A "Cycle Title" input field is available next to the cycle navigator. <br> - Clicking the button creates or overwrites `prompt.md` in the workspace root. <br> - The generated file has the correct structure: static schemas, then the dynamic cycle overview, then the content of `flattened_repo.md`. <br> - The cycle overview is built from the `dce_history.json` file and includes the title from the new input field. |

## 3. Technical Implementation Plan

1.  **UI (`parallel-copilot.view/view.tsx`):**
    *   Add a "Generate `prompt.md`" button to the main header toolbar.
    *   Add a new state variable and a corresponding `<input type="text">` element for the "Cycle Title" next to the cycle navigator.
    *   The button's `onClick` handler will send a new IPC message to the backend.

2.  **IPC Channels:**
    *   `ClientToServerChannel.RequestCreatePromptFile`: Payload will be `{ cycleTitle: string, currentCycle: number }`.

3.  **Backend (New `prompt.service.ts`):**
    *   Create a new `PromptService` to encapsulate the logic.
    *   **Static Templates:** The service will contain private string constants holding the content for `<M1. artifact schema>`, `<M3. Interaction Schema>`, and `<M4. current project scope>`.
    *   **`generatePromptFile` Method:** This method will be the core of the service.
        1.  It will receive the `cycleTitle` and `currentCycle` from the IPC message.
        2.  It will read the `dce_history.json` file (using `HistoryService`) to build the `<M2. cycle overview>` section dynamically.
        3.  It will read the entire content of `flattened_repo.md`.
        4.  It will assemble these strings in the correct order into a single, large string.
        5.  It will write this final string to `prompt.md` in the workspace root using `vscode.workspace.fs.writeFile`.
        6.  It will show a `showInformationMessage` to confirm completion.

4.  **Integration:**
    *   The new `PromptService` will be instantiated in `services.ts`.
    *   A new handler for `RequestCreatePromptFile` will be added to the `on-message.ts` for the Parallel Co-Pilot view, which will call the `PromptService`.
