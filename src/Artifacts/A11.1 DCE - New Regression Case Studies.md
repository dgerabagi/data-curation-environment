# Artifact A11.1: DCE - New Regression Case Studies
# Date Created: C1
# Author: AI Model & Curator

- **Key/Value for A0:**
- **Description:** A separate log for new regression case studies to avoid bloating the original A11 artifact.
- **Tags:** bugs, regression, troubleshooting, development, best practices

## 1. Purpose

This document serves as a living record of persistent or complex bugs that have recurred during development. By documenting the root cause analysis (RCA) and the confirmed solution for each issue, we create a "source of truth" that can be referenced to prevent the same mistakes from being reintroduced into the codebase. This artifact is a supplement to `A11`.

## 2. Case Studies

### Case Study 001: PCPP Context Textarea Instability

-   **Artifacts Affected:** `src/client/views/parallel-copilot.view/components/NumberedTextarea.tsx`, `src/client/views/parallel-copilot.view/components/ContextInputs.tsx`
-   **Cycles Observed:** C1, C2, C3, C167, C174, C1
-   **Symptom:** The "Cycle Context" and "Ephemeral Context" text fields in the PCPP become unusable when a large amount of text is entered. The cursor becomes misaligned, text selection is inaccurate, and the component is extremely slow, making it impossible to edit content effectively.
-   **Root Cause Analysis (RCA):** The `NumberedTextarea` component uses a complex overlay approach to render line numbers and syntax highlighting. A `div` with the highlighted content is rendered behind a transparent `<textarea>`. The instability is caused by a combination of:
    1.  **Performance:** The syntax highlighting is re-calculated on every single keystroke, which is computationally expensive for large blocks of text and causes severe input lag.
    2.  **Synchronization Failure:** Subtle differences in CSS (`font`, `padding`, `line-height`) and rendering between the overlay `div` and the transparent `textarea` cause a "drift" in alignment as content grows, leading to the cursor and selection bugs.
-   **Codified Solution & Best Practice:**
    1.  **Prioritize Stability:** For critical user inputs, stability and performance are more important than advanced features like line numbers or syntax highlighting.
    2.  **Simplify:** The complex `NumberedTextarea` component was replaced in `ContextInputs.tsx` with a standard, native `<textarea>` element.
    3.  **Conclusion:** This change guarantees a reliable and performant text input experience. While it represents a temporary removal of features, it fixes a critical usability bug. A more robust implementation of a custom code editor can be planned for a future cycle, but the default should always be a stable, native component.

### Case Study 002: FTV Flashing on PCPP Auto-Save

-   **Artifacts Affected:** `src/backend/services/file-tree.service.ts`
-   **Cycles Observed:** C1, C4, C1
-   **Symptom:** The entire Data Curation file tree view (FTV) flashes or completely reloads whenever the user stops typing in one of the Parallel Co-Pilot Panel's text areas.
-   **Root Cause Analysis (RCA):** The PCPP automatically saves its state to `dce_history.json` (located in the `.vscode` directory) after a brief period of inactivity. The backend `FileSystemWatcher` in `file-tree.service.ts` was configured to monitor the entire workspace for changes to trigger a refresh of the FTV. It was incorrectly reacting to the legitimate writes to the history file, treating it as a workspace change that required a full UI refresh. The initial fix was to add `.vscode` to a general exclusion pattern, but this was not specific enough.
-   **Codified Solution & Best Practice:**
    1.  **Be Specific in Watcher Exclusions:** The file watcher logic must be highly specific about what it ignores. The fix was to add an explicit check at the beginning of the `onDidCreate` and `onDidChange` handlers to immediately ignore any event related to the exact path of the history file (`.vscode/dce_history.json`).
    2.  **Example:** `if (normalizedPath.endsWith('.vscode/dce_history.json')) { return; }`. This prevents the watcher from reacting to the extension's own internal state changes while still correctly monitoring user-made changes to the workspace.
