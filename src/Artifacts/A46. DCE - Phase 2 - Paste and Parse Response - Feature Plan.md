# Artifact A46: DCE - Phase 2 - Paste and Parse Response - Feature Plan
# Date Created: C76
# Author: AI Model

- **Key/Value for A0:**
- **Description:** Details the plan for allowing users to paste a full AI response into a tab, which the extension will then parse to identify file paths referenced within XML tags.
- **Tags:** feature plan, phase 2, paste, parse, workflow, automation

## 1. Overview & Goal

The manual workflow for using the Parallel Co-Pilot involves copying an entire AI response and pasting it into one of the response tabs. These responses often contain multiple file updates, each wrapped in XML-like tags (e.g., `<file path="...">...</file>`). The goal of this feature is to make the extension "intelligent" about this pasted content. It should automatically parse the text, identify the files being modified, and associate them with the response tab.

## 2. User Story

| ID | User Story | Acceptance Criteria |
|---|---|---|
| P2-PARSE-01 | **Parse Pasted Content** | As a developer, when I paste a full AI response into a tab, I want the extension to automatically detect the file paths mentioned in the `<file>` tags, so I can see a list of affected files and use them for "Swap" and "Diff" operations. | - Pasting text into a response tab's editor triggers a parsing event. <br> - The extension uses a regular expression to find all occurrences of `<file path="...">`. <br> - The extracted file paths are stored in the state for that tab. <br> - The UI for the tab is updated to display the list of detected files. |
| P2-PARSE-02 | **Set Primary Source File** | As a developer, after pasting a response with multiple files, I want the first file detected to be automatically set as the primary "source file" for the "Swap" and "Diff" actions, so I don't have to select it manually. | - After parsing, if the tab's `sourceFilePath` is not already set, it is automatically populated with the path of the first file found in the pasted content. <br> - The metadata table (comparing original vs. response) updates accordingly. |

## 3. Technical Implementation Plan

1.  **Frontend Logic (`parallel-copilot.view/view.tsx`):**
    *   **Event Handler:** An `onPaste` event handler will be added to the `<textarea>` or code editor component for each tab.
    *   **Parsing Function:** A new utility function, `parseFilePathsFromResponse(text: string): string[]`, will be created.
        *   It will use a regular expression: `/<file path="([^"]+)">/g`.
        *   It will execute this regex on the input text to extract all captured file paths.
    *   **State Update:**
        *   Inside the `onPaste` handler, it will call `event.clipboardData.getData('text')` to get the pasted content.
        *   It will pass this content to the `parseFilePathsFromResponse` function.
        *   The resulting array of paths will be stored in the state for the active tab (e.g., in a new `detectedFiles: string[]` property).
        *   If the tab's primary `sourceFilePath` is empty, it will be set to the first path in the array.

2.  **UI Update (`parallel-copilot.view/view.tsx`):**
    *   A new UI element will be added to each tab's content area.
    *   It will conditionally render if `detectedFiles` has items.
    *   It will display a list of the detected file paths, perhaps as clickable links that could set the active `sourceFilePath` for the tab.

3.  **No Backend Changes:** This feature is entirely a frontend concern, involving UI event handling, string parsing, and state management within the React component.
