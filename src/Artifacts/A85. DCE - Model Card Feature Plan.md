# Artifact A85: DCE - Model Card Feature Plan
# Date Created: C17
# Author: AI Model & Curator

- **Key/Value for A0:**
- **Description:** A plan for a feature that allows users to create and manage 'model cards' for different LLMs, containing settings like context window size and display name.
- **Tags:** feature plan, settings, llm, model management, configuration

## 1. Overview & Goal

As the DCE project evolves to support direct API integration with various Large Language Models (LLMs), users will need a way to manage the configurations for these different models. The current settings panel is designed for a single local API URL.

The goal of this feature is to expand the settings panel to support "Model Cards." A model card will be a saved configuration profile for a specific LLM, containing all the necessary information for the extension to interact with it and for the user to select it for a given task.

## 2. User Stories

| ID | User Story | Acceptance Criteria |
|---|---|---|
| P2-MC-01 | **Create a Model Card** | As a user, I want to create a new model card in the settings panel, so I can configure a new local or cloud-based LLM for the extension to use. | - The settings panel has a "Create New Model Card" button. <br> - Clicking it opens a form with fields for all required model information. |
| P2-MC-02 | **Configure Model Parameters** | As a user creating a model card, I want to specify key parameters like the model's display name, its API endpoint, and its context window size, so the extension can use it correctly. | - The model card form includes input fields for: <br> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; - Display Name (e.g., "My Local Llama3") <br> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; - API Endpoint URL <br> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; - Context Window Size (in tokens) <br> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; - (Future) API Key, if applicable. |
| P2-MC-03 | **Default "AI Studio" Model** | As a user, I want a default, pre-configured model card labeled "AI Studio" that represents the free, manual copy/paste workflow, so I can easily switch back to it. | - The extension comes with a non-editable, default model card for "AI Studio". <br> - This card has no API endpoint and signifies the manual workflow. |
| P2-MC-04 | **Select Active Model** | As a user, I want to be able to select one of my configured model cards as the "active" model, so the extension knows which LLM to interact with. | - The settings panel displays a list of all saved model cards. <br> - A mechanism (e.g., radio buttons) allows me to select one as the active model. |

## 3. High-Level Technical Plan

-   **Data Storage:** Model card configurations will be stored in the global `settings.json` file under a new `dce.modelCards` configuration key.
-   **UI:** The `settings.view.tsx` component will be significantly refactored to include a list view for existing model cards and a form for creating/editing them.
-   **Backend:** A new `SettingsService` (or an expanded existing service) will manage reading and writing these configurations using the `vscode.workspace.getConfiguration` API.
