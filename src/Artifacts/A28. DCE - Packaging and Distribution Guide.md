- **Description:** Provides a step-by-step guide on how to package the extension into a `.vsix` file for beta testing and distribution.
- **Tags:** packaging, distribution, vsix, vsce, deployment

## 1. Overview

This document provides instructions on how to package the Data Curation Environment (DCE) extension into a single `.vsix` file. This file is the standard format for distributing and installing VS Code extensions, making it easy to share with beta testers or submit to the official marketplace.

The primary tool used for this process is `vsce` (Visual Studio Code Extensions), the official command-line tool for managing extensions.

## 2. Prerequisites

1.  **Node.js and npm:** You must have Node.js and npm installed.
2.  **Install `vsce`:** If you haven't already, install `vsce` globally by running the following command in your terminal:
    ```bash
    npm install -g @vscode/vsce
    ```

## 3. Packaging the Extension

Follow these steps in your terminal from the root directory of the DCE project (e.g., `C:\Projects\DCE`):

### Step 0: Update `package.json` (Important!)

Before packaging, ensure your `package.json` file is complete. The `vsce` tool will warn you if important fields are missing. At a minimum, make sure the following fields are present and correct:

-   `publisher`: Your publisher ID from the VS Code Marketplace.
-   `repository`: An object pointing to your source code repository (e.g., on GitHub).
-   `homepage`: A link to your project's homepage.
-   `bugs`: A link to your project's issue tracker.
-   `version`: Increment the version number for each new release.

### Step 1: Verify Static Asset Handling (CRITICAL)

The extension's backend code runs from the compiled `dist` directory. Any static files that the backend needs to read at runtime (like our `T*` template artifacts in `src/Artifacts`) **must be copied into the `dist` directory** during the build process.

-   **Check `webpack.config.js`:** Ensure the `CopyPlugin` includes a rule to copy `src/Artifacts` to the `dist` folder.
    ```javascript
    // Example rule in CopyPlugin patterns:
    { from: "src/Artifacts", to: "Artifacts" }
    ```
-   **Check Backend Code:** Ensure any code that reads these files (e.g., `prompt.service.ts`) constructs the path relative to the final `dist` directory (e.g., `path.join(context.extensionPath, 'dist', 'Artifacts', ...)`).

### Step 2: Ensure Dependencies are Installed

Make sure your project's dependencies are up to date.

```bash
npm install
```

### Step 3: Create a Production Build

Before packaging, it's essential to create an optimized production build of the extension. Our `package.json` already has a script for this.

```bash
npm run package
```

This command runs webpack in `production` mode, which minifies the code and removes source maps, resulting in a smaller and faster extension. It will update the files in the `/dist` directory.

### Step 4: Run the Packaging Command

Once the production build is complete, you can run the `vsce` packaging command.

```bash
vsce package
```

This command will:
1.  Read the `package.json` manifest file.
2.  Gather all the necessary files, respecting the rules in `.vscodeignore`.
3.  Bundle everything into a single file named `data-curation-environment-X.X.X.vsix`, where `X.X.X` is the version number from `package.json`.

You will see the `.vsix` file in the root of your project directory.

## 4. Sharing and Installing the `.vsix` File

### For Beta Testers:

1.  **Share the File:** You can send the generated `.vsix` file directly to your testers (e.g., via email, Slack, or a shared drive).

2.  **Installation Instructions:** Your testers can install it in VS Code by following these steps:
    *   Open VS Code.
    *   Go to the **Extensions** view (Ctrl+Shift+X).
    *   Click the **...** (More Actions) button at the top of the Extensions view.
    *   Select **"Install from VSIX..."**.
    *   In the file dialog that opens, navigate to and select the `.vsix` file you provided.
    *   VS Code will install the extension and prompt for a reload.
