# Date Created: C76
# Author: AI Model
# Updated on: C78 (Reflect implementation of WebviewPanel)

- **Key/Value for A0:**
- **Description:** Outlines the technical strategy to allow the Parallel Co-Pilot panel to be "popped out" into a separate window by re-implementing it as a main editor WebviewPanel.
- **Tags:** feature plan, phase 2, pop-out, window, webview, ux

## 1. Overview & Goal

The Parallel Co-Pilot panel is designed for intensive, side-by-side comparison of code, a task that benefits greatly from maximum screen real estate. Many developers use multiple monitors and would prefer to move this panel to a secondary display. The goal of this feature is to enable the user to "pop out" the Parallel Co-Pilot panel into its own floating window.

## 2. Problem & Proposed Solution

A direct `popOut()` API for a sidebar webview does not exist in the VS Code extension API. The most robust and user-friendly way to achieve this is to leverage a native VS Code feature: users can drag any editor tab into its own floating window.

Therefore, the proposed solution is to **re-architect the Parallel Co-Pilot from a sidebar view (`WebviewViewProvider`) into a main editor view (`WebviewPanel`)**.

### 2.1. User Experience Flow

1.  The user runs the `DCE: Open Parallel Co-Pilot` command from the Command Palette or clicks the icon in the Activity Bar.
2.  Instead of opening in the sidebar, the Parallel Co-Pilot panel opens as a new tab in the main editor group.
3.  The user can then click and drag this tab out of the main VS Code window, and it will become its own floating window, which can be moved to another monitor.

## 3. User Stories

| ID | User Story | Acceptance Criteria |
|---|---|---|
| P2-WIN-01 | **Open Co-Pilot in Main Editor**| As a developer, I want a command or button to open the Parallel Co-Pilot panel in a main editor tab, so I have more horizontal space to view and compare responses. | - A command `DCE: Open Parallel Co-Pilot` exists. <br> - An icon in the activity bar triggers this command. <br> - Executing the command opens a new editor tab containing the full Co-Pilot UI. <br> - If the panel is already open, the command brings it into focus. |
| P2-WIN-02 | **Move Co-Pilot to New Window** | As a developer with multiple monitors, after opening the Co-Pilot in an editor tab, I want to drag that tab out of my main VS Code window to turn it into a separate, floating window, so I can place it on my second monitor. | - The Co-Pilot editor tab behaves like any other editor tab. <br> - It can be dragged to create new editor groups or dragged outside the main window to create a new floating window. |

## 4. Technical Implementation Plan (C78)

This is a significant architectural change that has been implemented.

1.  **Remove Sidebar Contribution (`package.json`):**
    *   The `dce-parallel-copilot` entry in `contributes.viewsContainers.activitybar` still exists to provide an entry point icon, but the view is no longer directly registered under `contributes.views`.

2.  **Create a `WebviewPanel` (`extension.ts`):**
    *   A new command, `dce.openParallelCopilot`, is registered.
    *   A module-level variable (`private static parallelCopilotPanel: vscode.WebviewPanel | undefined;`) is used to track the panel's instance, ensuring only one can exist.
    *   When the command is executed, it checks if the panel already exists. If so, it calls `panel.reveal()`.
    *   If not, it calls `vscode.window.createWebviewPanel`. This creates the webview in an editor tab.
    *   The panel's `onDidDispose` event is used to clear the static instance variable.
    *   The logic for setting the webview's HTML, options, and message handlers is now managed within this command's callback.

3.  **State Management:**
    *   Because the panel is now created on-demand, its state (tab content, cycle number) must be managed in a backend service to be restored if the panel is closed and reopened. This is a future enhancement. For now, the state is ephemeral to the panel's lifecycle.
