- **Key/Value for A0:**
- **Description:** A plan for implementing standard file explorer context menu actions (e.g., Rename, Delete, Copy Path) in the custom file tree.

## 1. Overview & Goal

To enhance the user experience and make the Data Curation Environment a more complete replacement for the native VS Code explorer, this feature adds standard right-click context menus. The goal is to provide essential file and list management operations directly within our extension's view, reducing the need for users to switch contexts for common tasks.

This plan covers two distinct context menus: one for the main file tree and one for the "Selected Items" list.

## 2. Main File Tree Context Menu

| ID | User Story | Acceptance Criteria |
|---|---|---|
| US-01 | **Copy Path** | As a user, I want to right-click a file or folder and copy its absolute or relative path to my clipboard, so I can easily reference it elsewhere. | - Right-clicking a node in the file tree opens a context menu. <br> - The menu contains "Copy Path" and "Copy Relative Path" options. <br> - Selecting an option copies the corresponding path string to the system clipboard. |
| US-02 | **Rename File/Folder** | As a user, I want to right-click a file or folder and rename it, so I can correct mistakes or refactor my project structure. | - The context menu contains a "Rename" option. <br> - Selecting it turns the file/folder name into an editable input field. <br> - Pressing Enter or clicking away saves the new name. <br> - The underlying file/folder is renamed on the file system. <br> - The file tree updates to reflect the change. |
| US-03 | **Delete File/Folder** | As a user, I want to right-click a file or folder and delete it, so I can remove unnecessary files from my project. | - The context menu contains a "Delete" option. <br> - Selecting it shows a confirmation dialog to prevent accidental deletion. <br> - Upon confirmation, the file or folder (and its contents, recursively) is moved to the trash/recycling bin. <br> - The file tree updates to reflect the change. |
| US-04 | **Reveal in OS Explorer** | As a user, I want to right-click a file or folder and have it revealed in the native OS file explorer, so I can interact with it outside of VS Code. | - The context menu contains a "Reveal in File Explorer" (or "Reveal in Finder" on macOS) option. <br> - Selecting it opens the parent directory of the item in the **operating system's default file manager** (e.g., Windows File Explorer) with the item selected. This should not simply switch to the VS Code Explorer tab. |
| US-05 | **New File/Folder** | As a user, I want to create new files and folders from the toolbar or context menu in the correct location, so I can build out my project structure without leaving the view. | - The header toolbar has "New File" and "New Folder" buttons. <br> - Clicking either prompts for a name. <br> - The new file/folder is created in the directory of the currently *active/highlighted* item in the tree. <br> - If the active item is a file, the new item is created in that file's parent directory. <br> - If no item is active, it defaults to the workspace root. <br> - The file tree automatically refreshes. |

## 3. "Selected Items" Panel Context Menu

| ID | User Story | Acceptance Criteria |
|---|---|---|
| US-06 | **Select All/Deselect All** | As a user, I want to right-click in the "Selected Items" panel to quickly select or deselect all items in the list, so I can perform batch removal operations more efficiently. | - Right-clicking anywhere within the list of selected files opens a context menu. <br> - The menu contains a "Select All" option. <br> - Clicking "Select All" highlights every item in the list, updating the "Remove selected" button count. <br> - The menu also contains a "Deselect All" option. <br> - Clicking "Deselect All" clears all selections in the list. |

## 4. Technical Implementation Plan

-   **Main Tree Menu:** Implemented in `TreeView.tsx` and `ContextMenu.tsx` using an `onContextMenu` event handler and state management to control visibility and position.
-   **"Selected Items" Menu (C37):**
    1.  **State Management (`SelectedFilesView.tsx`):** Add state to manage the menu's visibility and coordinates: `const [contextMenu, setContextMenu] = useState<{ x: number, y: number } | null>(null);`.
    2.  **Event Handling (`SelectedFilesView.tsx`):** Add an `onContextMenu` handler to the main `ul` element. This will prevent the default menu and set the state to render the custom menu.
    3.  **Component Rendering (`SelectedFilesView.tsx`):** Conditionally render a new context menu component based on the state. The component will have two list items: "Select All" and "Deselect All".
    4.  **Actions (`SelectedFilesView.tsx`):**
        *   The "Select All" `onClick` handler will create a `Set` from all paths in the `sortedFiles` prop and call `setSelection` with it.
        *   The "Deselect All" `onClick` handler will call `setSelection(new Set())`.
        *   Both actions will close the menu by setting `setContextMenu(null)`.
    5.  **Styling (`view.scss`):** Add CSS rules for the new context menu to match the existing one.
