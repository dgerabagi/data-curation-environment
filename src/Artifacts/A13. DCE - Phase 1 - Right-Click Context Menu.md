- **Key/Value for A0:**
- **Description:** A plan for implementing standard file explorer context menu actions (e.g., Rename, Delete, Copy Path) in the custom file tree and other UI lists.
- **Tags:** feature plan, context menu, right-click, file operations, ux, phase 1

## 1. Overview & Goal

To enhance the user experience and make the Data Curation Environment a more complete replacement for the native VS Code explorer, this feature adds standard right-click context menus. The goal is to provide essential file and list management operations directly within our extension's view, reducing the need for users to switch contexts for common tasks.

This plan covers three distinct context menus: one for the main file tree, one for the "Selected Items" list, and one for the "Associated Files" list in the Parallel Co-Pilot Panel.

## 2. Main File Tree Context Menu

| ID | User Story | Acceptance Criteria |
|---|---|---|
| US-01 | **Copy Path** | As a user, I want to right-click a file or folder and copy its absolute or relative path to my clipboard, so I can easily reference it elsewhere. | - Right-clicking a node in the file tree opens a context menu. <br> - The menu contains "Copy Path" and "Copy Relative Path" options. <br> - Selecting an option copies the corresponding path string to the system clipboard. |
| US-02 | **Rename File/Folder** | As a user, I want to right-click a file or folder and rename it, so I can correct mistakes or refactor my project structure. | - The context menu contains a "Rename" option. <br> - Selecting it turns the file/folder name into an editable input field. <br> - Pressing Enter or clicking away saves the new name. <br> - The underlying file/folder is renamed on the file system. <br> - The file tree updates to reflect the change. |
| US-03 | **Delete File/Folder** | As a user, I want to right-click a file or folder and delete it, so I can remove unnecessary files from my project. | - The context menu contains a "Delete" option. <br> - Selecting it shows a confirmation dialog to prevent accidental deletion. <br> - Upon confirmation, the file or folder (and its contents, recursively) is moved to the trash/recycling bin. <br> - The file tree updates to reflect the change. |
| US-04 | **Reveal in OS Explorer** | As a user, I want to right-click a file or folder and have it revealed in the native OS file explorer, so I can interact with it outside of VS Code. | - The context menu contains a "Reveal in File Explorer" (or "Reveal in Finder" on macOS) option. <br> - Selecting it opens the parent directory of the item in the **operating system's default file manager** (e.g., Windows File Explorer) with the item selected. This should not simply switch to the VS Code Explorer tab. |
| US-05 | **New File/Folder** | As a user, I want to create new files and folders from the toolbar or context menu in the correct location, so I can build out my project structure without leaving the view. | - The header toolbar has "New File" and "New Folder" buttons. <br> - Clicking either prompts for a name. <br> - The new file/folder is created in the directory of the currently *active/highlighted* item in the tree. <br> - If the active item is a file, the new item is created in that file's parent directory. <br> - If no item is active, it defaults to the workspace root. <br> - The file tree automatically refreshes. |

## 3. "Selected Items" Panel Context Menu

| ID | User Story | Acceptance Criteria |
|---|---|---|
| US-06 | **Select All/Deselect All** | As a user, I want to right-click in the "Selected Items" panel to quickly select or deselect all items in the list, so I can perform batch removal operations more efficiently. | - Right-clicking anywhere within the list of selected files opens a context menu. <br> - The menu contains a "Select All" option. <br> - Clicking "Select All" highlights every item in the list, updating the "Remove selected" button count. <br> - The menu also contains a "Deselect All" option. <br> - Clicking "Deselect All" clears all selections in the list. |

## 4. "Associated Files" List Actions (C131)

| ID | User Story | Acceptance Criteria |
|---|---|---|
| US-07 | **Create Missing File** | As a developer, when an AI response refers to a file that doesn't exist, I want an easy way to create it directly from the "Associated Files" list, so I can quickly implement the AI's suggestion for a new file. | - In the "Associated Files" list, a file that does not exist is marked with an '✗'. <br> - When I hover over this item, a "Create File" button appears next to it. <br> - Clicking the button creates a new, empty file at that path in the workspace. <br> - The file tree and the "Associated Files" list automatically refresh, and the indicator changes to a '✓'. |

## 5. Technical Implementation Plan

-   **Main Tree Menu:** Implemented in `TreeView.tsx` and `ContextMenu.tsx` using an `onContextMenu` event handler and state management to control visibility and position.
-   **"Selected Items" Menu (C37):** Implemented in `SelectedFilesView.tsx` with its own context menu state and handlers for "Select All" / "Deselect All".
-   **"Create Missing File" Action (C131):**
    1.  **IPC:** Create a new `ClientToServerChannel.RequestCreateFile` channel with a payload of `{ filePath: string }`.
    2.  **Backend (`file-operation.service.ts`):** Implement `handleCreateFileRequest`. It will receive the relative path, resolve it to an absolute path, and use `vscode.workspace.fs.writeFile` with an empty `Uint8Array` to create the file. The file watcher will trigger a refresh.
    3.  **Frontend (`view.tsx`):** In the "Associated Files" list rendering logic, if a file does not exist (`!fileExistenceMap.get(file)`), render a "Create File" button. The button will be visible on hover. Its `onClick` handler will send the new IPC message.
