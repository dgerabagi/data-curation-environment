## 4. Step-by-Step Setup Instructions

### Step 1: Clone the Repository

First, clone the project repository from GitHub to your local machine.

```bash
# Replace with your repository URL
git clone https://github.com/your-username/your-project.git
cd your-project
```

### Step 2: Install Project Dependencies

Next, install all the necessary project dependencies using your package manager.

```bash
# For npm
npm install

# For yarn
# yarn install
```

### Step 3: Configure Environment Variables

Create a `.env` file in the root of the project by copying the example file.

```bash
cp .env.example .env
```

Now, open the `.env` file and fill in the required environment variables:
-   `API_KEY`: [Description of what this key is for]
-   `DATABASE_URL`: [Description of the database connection string]

### Step 4: Run the Development Server

To start the local development server, run the following command. This will typically compile the code and watch for any changes you make.

```bash
# For npm
npm run dev

# For yarn
# yarn dev
```

### Step 5: Verify the Setup

Once the development server is running, you should be able to access the application at [e.g., `http://localhost:3000`]. [Describe what the developer should see to confirm that the setup was successful].
