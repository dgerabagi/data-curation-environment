# Artifact A40: DCE - Phase 2 - Parallel Co-Pilot - Target File Structure
# Date Created: C71
# Author: AI Model

- **Key/Value for A0:**
- **Description:** A text-based representation of the new files and components required to build the Phase 2 Parallel Co-Pilot and Cycle Navigator features.
- **Tags:** file structure, architecture, project layout, scaffolding, phase 2

## 1. Overview

This document outlines the new files and directories that will be created to support the development of the Phase 2 features: the Parallel Co-Pilot Panel and the Cycle Navigator. This structure is designed to be modular and integrate cleanly with our existing architecture. This artifact also serves as the "pre-computation" plan requested in C71, allowing for a script to be created to scaffold these files when development begins.

## 2. New File Tree for Phase 2

This tree shows only the **new** files and directories to be added. Existing directories will be modified to import and use these new components.

## 3. Component & Service Descriptions

### Backend

-   **`src/backend/services/history.service.ts`:**
    -   **Responsibility:** Solely responsible for abstracting the file I/O for the `dce_history.json` file.
    -   **Methods:** `getCycleHistory()`, `getCycleData(cycleId)`, `saveResponseToCycle(...)`. This keeps the main `fs.service.ts` clean from business logic.

### Frontend Components

-   **`src/client/views/parallel-copilot.view/`:**
    -   This new directory will contain everything needed for the new panel, following the same structure as our existing `context-chooser.view`.
    -   `view.tsx` will be the main component, managing the state for all tabs, the current cycle, and orchestrating IPC communication.
-   **`src/client/components/TabbedEditor.tsx`:**
    -   A component that will manage the tab bar and the content of each tab editor, receiving the array of tab data as props.
-   **`src/client/components/Slider.tsx`:**
    -   A simple, reusable slider component to control the number of tabs. This extracts UI logic from the main view.
-   **`src/client/utils/string-similarity.ts`:**
    -   Will contain a function to calculate the similarity between two strings, likely implementing the Dice Coefficient or a similar algorithm. This keeps the calculation logic separate and testable.

### Root Directory

-   **`.vscode/dce_history.json`:**
    -   This file will be automatically created and managed by the `HistoryService`. Storing it in `.vscode` is standard practice for workspace-specific extension data that should not typically be checked into source control. It will be added to `.gitignore`.
