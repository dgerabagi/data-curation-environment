## 1. Overview

This guide provides the necessary commands to turn your local project folder into a Git repository and link it to a new, empty repository on GitHub. It also describes a sample workflow for using Git to efficiently test multiple AI-generated responses.

## 2. Prerequisites

*   You have `git` installed on your machine.
*   You have a GitHub account.

## 3. Step-by-Step Setup

### Step 1: Create a New Repository on GitHub

1.  Go to [github.com](https://github.com) and log in.
2.  In the top-right corner, click the `+` icon and select **"New repository"**.
3.  **Repository name:** A good name would be `data-curation-environment` or `vscode-dce-extension`.
4.  **Description:** (Optional) "A VS Code extension for curating context for Large Language Models."
5.  Choose **"Private"** or **"Public"** based on your preference.
6.  **IMPORTANT:** Do **not** initialize the repository with a `README`, `.gitignore`, or `license`. We will be pushing our existing files, and this will prevent conflicts.
7.  Click **"Create repository"**.

GitHub will now show you a page with several command-line instructions. We will use the section titled **"...or push an existing repository from the command line"**.

### Step 2: Initialize Git in Your Local Project

Open a terminal (like the one integrated into VS Code) and navigate to your project's root directory (e.g., `C:\Projects\DCE`). Then, run the following commands one by one.

1.  **Initialize the repository:** This creates a new `.git` subdirectory in your project folder.
    ```bash
    git init
    ```

2.  **Add all existing files to the staging area:** The `.` adds all files in the current directory and subdirectories.
    ```bash
    git add .
    ```

3.  **Create the first commit:** This saves the staged files to the repository's history.
    ```bash
    git commit -m "Initial commit"
    ```

4.  **Rename the default branch to `main`:** This is the modern standard, replacing the older `master`.
    ```bash
    git branch -M main
    ```

### Step 3: Link and Push to GitHub

Now, you will link your local repository to the empty one you created on GitHub.

1.  **Add the remote repository:** Replace the URL with the one from your GitHub repository page. It should look like the example below.
    ```bash
    git remote add origin https://github.com/dgerabagi/data-curation-environment.git
    ```

2.  **Push your local `main` branch to GitHub:** The `-u` flag sets the upstream remote so that in the future, you can simply run `git push`.
    ```bash
    git push -u origin main
    ```

After these commands complete, refresh your GitHub repository page. You should see all of your project files. You have successfully created and linked your repository.

## 4. Sample Workflow for Testing AI Responses

Once your project is set up with Git, you can leverage it to create a powerful and non-destructive testing workflow with the DCE.

1.  **Start with a Clean State:** Make sure your working directory is clean. You can check this with `git status`. If you have any uncommitted changes, either commit them or stash them.
2.  **Generate Responses:** Use the DCE to generate a `prompt.md` file and get several responses from your AI. Paste these into the Parallel Co-Pilot Panel and parse them.
3.  **Accept a Response:** Choose the response you want to test (e.g., "Resp 1"). Select its files in the "Associated Files" list and click "Accept Selected Files". This will overwrite the files in your workspace.
4.  **Test the Changes:** Run your project's build process (`npm run watch`), check for errors, and test the functionality in the VS Code Extension Development Host.
5.  **Revert and Test the Next One:**
    *   If you're not satisfied with the changes from "Resp 1," you can instantly and safely revert all the changes by running a single command in your terminal:
        ```bash
        git restore .
        ```
    *   This command discards all uncommitted changes in your working directory, restoring your files to the state of your last commit.
6.  **Repeat:** Your workspace is now clean again. You can go back to the Parallel Co-Pilot Panel, accept the files from "Resp 2," and repeat the testing process.

This workflow allows you to rapidly test multiple complex, multi-file changes from different AI responses without the risk of permanently breaking your codebase.
