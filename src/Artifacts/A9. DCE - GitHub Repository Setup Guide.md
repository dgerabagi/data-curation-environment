- **Description:** A step-by-step guide with the necessary git commands to initialize the project as a local repository and push it to a new remote repository on GitHub.
- **Tags:** git, github, version control, setup, repository

## 1. Overview

This guide provides the necessary commands to turn your local project folder into a Git repository and link it to a new, empty repository on GitHub.

## 2. Prerequisites

*   You have `git` installed on your machine.
*   You have a GitHub account.
*   Your GitHub username is `dgerabagi`.

## 3. Step-by-Step Instructions

### Step 1: Create a New Repository on GitHub

1.  Go to [github.com](https://github.com) and log in.
2.  In the top-right corner, click the `+` icon and select **"New repository"**.
3.  **Repository name:** A good name would be `data-curation-environment` or `vscode-dce-extension`.
4.  **Description:** (Optional) "A VS Code extension for curating context for Large Language Models."
5.  Choose **"Private"** or **"Public"** based on your preference.
6.  **IMPORTANT:** Do **not** initialize the repository with a `README`, `.gitignore`, or `license`. We will be pushing our existing files, and this will prevent conflicts.
7.  Click **"Create repository"**.

GitHub will now show you a page with several command-line instructions. We will use the section titled **"...or push an existing repository from the command line"**.

### Step 2: Initialize Git in Your Local Project

Open a terminal (like the one integrated into VS Code) and navigate to your project's root directory (e.g., `C:\Projects\DCE`). Then, run the following commands one by one.

1.  **Initialize the repository:** This creates a new `.git` subdirectory in your project folder.
    ```bash
    git init
    ```

2.  **Add all existing files to the staging area:** The `.` adds all files in the current directory and subdirectories.
    ```bash
    git add .
    ```

3.  **Create the first commit:** This saves the staged files to the repository's history.
    ```bash
    git commit -m "Initial commit"
    ```

4.  **Rename the default branch to `main`:** This is the modern standard, replacing the older `master`.
    ```bash
    git branch -M main
    ```

### Step 3: Link and Push to GitHub

Now, you will link your local repository to the empty one you created on GitHub.

1.  **Add the remote repository:** Replace the URL with the one from your GitHub repository page. It should look like the example below.
    ```bash
    git remote add origin https://github.com/dgerabagi/data-curation-environment.git
    ```

2.  **Push your local `main` branch to GitHub:** The `-u` flag sets the upstream remote so that in the future, you can simply run `git push`.
    ```bash
    git push -u origin main
    ```

After these commands complete, refresh your GitHub repository page. You should see all of your project files. You have successfully created and linked your repository!
