- **Key/Value for A0:**
- **Description:** Outlines the user stories and technical plan for a settings UI where users can securely input and manage their API keys for various LLM services or a local endpoint URL.
- **Tags:** feature plan, phase 2, settings, api key, configuration, security

## 1. Overview & Goal

As the DCE project moves into Phase 2, it will begin to make its own API calls to LLM providers. To do this securely and flexibly, the extension needs a dedicated interface for users to manage their API keys and specify a local LLM endpoint. The goal of this feature is to provide a simple, secure, and intuitive settings panel for managing these credentials.

This functionality is heavily inspired by the `ApiKeysManagement.tsx` module in the `The-Creator-AI-main` reference repository.

## 2. User Stories

| ID | User Story | Acceptance Criteria |
|---|---|---|
| P2-API-01 | **Configure API Key** | As a user, I want to add an API key for a specific cloud service (e.g., Gemini, OpenAI), so the extension can make API calls on my behalf. | - A UI is available to add a new API key. <br> - I can select the LLM provider from a dropdown list. <br> - I can paste my key into a text field. <br> - The key is stored securely using VS Code's `SecretStorage` API. |
| P2-API-02 | **Configure Local LLM Endpoint** | As a user with a local LLM (e.g., via LM Studio), I want to provide an API endpoint URL, so the extension can use my local model instead of a cloud service. | - The settings UI has a dedicated input field for a local LLM API URL. <br> - The URL is saved to the workspace settings. <br> - The extension prioritizes using this URL if it is set. |
| P2-API-03 | **View Saved Keys** | As a user, I want to see a list of my saved API keys (partially masked), so I can confirm which keys I have configured. | - The settings UI displays a list of all saved API keys. <br> - Keys are grouped by service. <br> - The key values are partially masked for security (e.g., `sk-xxxx...1234`). |
| P2-API-04 | **Delete an API Key** | As a user, I want to delete an API key that I no longer use, so I can manage my credentials. | - Each listed API key has a "Delete" button. <br> - Clicking "Delete" prompts for confirmation. <br> - Upon confirmation, the key is removed from the extension's secure storage. |
| P2-API-05 | **Secure Storage** | As a developer, I want API keys to be stored securely using VS Code's `SecretStorage` API, so sensitive user credentials are not exposed as plain text. | - API keys are not stored in plain text in `settings.json` or workspace state. <br> - The `SecretStorage` API is used to encrypt and store the keys, associating them with the extension. |

## 3. Technical Implementation Plan

1.  **New View / Command:**
    *   A new command, `dce.openApiSettings`, will be created. This command will open a new webview panel dedicated to API key management. This keeps the UI clean and separate from the main workflow panels.
    *   This can be triggered from a "Settings" icon within the Parallel Co-pilot view.

2.  **Backend (`settings.service.ts` - New):**
    *   A new `SettingsService` will be created to handle the logic for storing and retrieving secrets and settings.
    *   **API Key Storage:** It will use `vscode.ExtensionContext.secrets` (the `SecretStorage` API) for all API key operations.
    -   **Local URL Storage:** It will use the standard `vscode.workspace.getConfiguration` API to get/set the local LLM URL in the workspace `settings.json`.
    *   **Methods:** It will expose methods like `setApiKey(service: string, key: string)`, `getApiKeys()`, `deleteApiKey(service: string)`, `getLocalLlmUrl()`, and `setLocalLlmUrl(url: string)`. The `getApiKeys` method will return a structure with masked keys for the UI.

3.  **Frontend (New `api-settings.view.tsx`):**
    *   This new React view will render the UI for managing keys and the local endpoint URL.
    *   It will communicate with the backend `SettingsService` via new IPC channels.

4.  **IPC Channels:**
    *   `RequestApiKeys`: Frontend asks for the list of saved (masked) keys.
    *   `SendApiKeys`: Backend sends the list of keys.
    *   `SaveApiKey`: Frontend sends a new service and key to the backend.
    *   `DeleteApiKey`: Frontend requests the deletion of a specific key.
    *   `RequestLocalLlmUrl` / `SendLocalLlmUrl`
    *   `SaveLocalLlmUrl`
