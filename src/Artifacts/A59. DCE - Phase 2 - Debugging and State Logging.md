- **Key/Value for A0:**
- **Description:** Documents the plan for a "Log State" button that outputs critical state information (cycle history, current inputs) to the debug channel to accelerate troubleshooting.

## 1. Overview & Goal

Debugging complex state interactions in the Parallel Co-Pilot Panel can be challenging, as it often requires the curator to manually describe the state of multiple text fields and selections. To accelerate this process, a dedicated debugging feature is required.

The goal of this feature is to add a **"Log State"** button to the PCPP's main header. When clicked, this button will generate a comprehensive, formatted log of the panel's current state and send it to the "Data Curation Environment" output channel. This allows the curator to easily copy and paste the exact state of the application into their feedback, eliminating ambiguity and speeding up bug resolution.

## 2. User Story

| ID | User Story | Acceptance Criteria |
|---|---|---|
| P2-LOG-01 | **Log Current State for Debugging** | As a curator encountering a bug, I want to click a "Log State" button that outputs the current state of the entire PCPP to the debug logs, so I can easily copy and paste this information for you to reproduce the issue. | - A "Log State" button is present in the main header of the PCPP. <br> - Clicking the button generates a formatted message in the "Data Curation Environment" output channel. <br> - **(C180 Update)** The log output is now focused specifically on the state variables relevant to cycle management to diagnose the "stuck on new cycle" bug. It will include: <br> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 1. A summary of the key frontend state variables (`currentCycle`, `maxCycle`, `isNewCycleButtonDisabled`). <br> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 2. A truncated JSON dump of the entire `dce_history.json` file from the backend for comparison. |

## 3. Technical Implementation Plan

1.  **UI (`view.tsx`):**
    *   A "Log State" button will be added to the main header toolbar.
    *   Its `onClick` handler will gather the complete current state of the panel into a single `PcppCycle` object and send it to the backend via a new IPC message.

2.  **IPC Channels (`channels.enum.ts`, `channels.type.ts`):**
    *   Create a new `ClientToServerChannel.RequestLogState`.
    *   The payload will be `{ currentState: PcppCycle }`.

3.  **Backend Logic (`prompt.service.ts`):**
    *   A new public method, `public async generateStateLog(currentState: PcppCycle)`, will be created.
    *   **Step 1: Generate Formatted State Dump (C180 Revision):**
        *   It will fetch the full history from `history.service.ts`.
        *   It will construct a focused log string containing the most relevant frontend state variables for the current bug (`currentCycle`, `maxCycle`, `isNewCycleButtonDisabled`, `cycleTitle`, `cycleContext`, `selectedResponseId`).
        *   It will append a `JSON.stringify` of the full (but truncated) history file content.
    *   **Step 2: Log to Output Channel:**
        *   It will combine these strings into a single, clearly labeled log message and send it to `Services.loggerService.log()`.
