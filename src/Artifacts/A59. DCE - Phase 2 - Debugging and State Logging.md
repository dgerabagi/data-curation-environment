- **Key/Value for A0:**
- **Description:** Documents the plan for a "Log State" button that outputs critical state information (cycle history, current inputs) to the debug channel to accelerate troubleshooting.

## 1. Overview & Goal

Debugging complex state interactions in the Parallel Co-Pilot Panel can be challenging, as it often requires the curator to manually describe the state of multiple text fields and selections. To accelerate this process, a dedicated debugging feature is required.

The goal of this feature is to add a **"Log State"** button to the PCPP's main header. When clicked, this button will generate a comprehensive, formatted log of the panel's current state and send it to the "Data Curation Environment" output channel. This allows the curator to easily copy and paste the exact state of the application into their feedback, eliminating ambiguity and speeding up bug resolution.

## 2. User Story

| ID | User Story | Acceptance Criteria |
|---|---|---|
| P2-LOG-01 | **Log Current State for Debugging** | As a curator encountering a bug, I want to click a "Log State" button that outputs the current state of the entire PCPP to the debug logs, so I can easily copy and paste this information for you to reproduce the issue. | - A "Log State" button is present in the main header of the PCPP. <br> - Clicking the button generates a formatted message in the "Data Curation Environment" output channel. <br> - The log contains two key pieces of information: <br> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 1. A formatted JSON dump of the current state of all cycle data (titles, contexts, raw responses). <br> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 2. The exact `<M6. Cycles>` block that *would be* generated for `prompt.md` based on the current state. <br> - **(C137 Update)** The `content` of AI responses within the JSON dump is truncated to show only the first and last few lines, making the log more readable. |

## 3. Technical Implementation Plan

1.  **UI (`view.tsx`):**
    *   A "Log State" button will be added to the main header toolbar.
    *   Its `onClick` handler will gather the complete current state of the panel into a single `PcppCycle` object and send it to the backend via a new IPC message.

2.  **IPC Channels (`channels.enum.ts`, `channels.type.ts`):**
    *   Create a new `ClientToServerChannel.RequestLogState`.
    *   The payload will be `{ currentState: PcppCycle }`.

3.  **Backend Logic (`prompt.service.ts`):**
    *   A new public method, `public async generateStateLog(currentState: PcppCycle)`, will be created.
    *   **Step 1: Generate Formatted State Dump:**
        *   It will call `Services.historyService.getFullHistory()` to get all historical cycle data.
        *   **(C137)** It will iterate through the `currentState` and `fullHistory` objects, applying a new `truncateCodeForLogging` utility function to the `content` property of each response.
        *   It will create a new object containing the truncated state data and `JSON.stringify` it for readability.
    *   **Step 2: Generate `<M6. Cycles>` Content:**
        *   It will re-use the existing logic from `generatePromptFile` to construct the complete `<M6. Cycles>` string.
    *   **Step 3: Log to Output Channel:**
        *   It will combine these two strings into a single, clearly labeled log message and send it to `Services.loggerService.log()`.

4.  **Utility (`formatting.ts`):**
    *   A new `truncateCodeForLogging` function will be created to implement the content truncation logic.
