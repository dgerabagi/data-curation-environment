## I. General & Getting Started

### Q: What is the Data Curation Environment (DCE)?
**A:** The Data Curation Environment is a VS Code extension designed to streamline and enhance the workflow of AI-assisted development. It provides an integrated toolset for managing the context (code, documents, etc.) you provide to Large Language Models (LLMs), comparing multiple AI responses in parallel, and safely testing AI-generated code.

### Q: Who is the DCE for?
**A:** The DCE is for any developer, researcher, or project manager who uses Large Language Models as part of their development process. It's particularly useful for those working on complex projects who need to maintain high-quality, consistent context for their AI interactions and want to manage multiple AI suggestions efficiently.

### Q: How do I install the DCE?
**A:** The DCE is packaged as a `.vsix` file. You can install it in VS Code by going to the **Extensions** view, clicking the **...** (More Actions) menu, and selecting **"Install from VSIX..."**. For a detailed guide, please refer to `A28. DCE - Packaging and Distribution Guide.md`.

### Q: Is there a "demo" mode?
**A:** Yes. The DCE includes a "Demo Mode" that connects to a local, open-source LLM running via vLLM. This allows you to experience the full automated workflow, including response streaming and parallel generation, without needing your own API keys. See `A94. DCE - Connecting to a Local LLM Guide.md` for setup instructions.

## II. Core Concepts & Workflow

### Q: What is an "Artifact"?
**A:** In the DCE workflow, an "Artifact" is a formal, written document (like a project plan, requirements document, or even this FAQ) that serves as a "source of truth." The core principle of DCE is "Documentation First"—you and your AI partner should create or update these artifacts to define a plan before writing code.

### Q: What is a "Cycle"?
**A:** A "Cycle" represents one complete iteration of the development loop: you provide context to the AI, you receive responses, you select the best one, and you integrate its changes. The DCE's Parallel Co-Pilot Panel allows you to navigate through your project's history, cycle by cycle.

### Q: What is the "Source of Truth"?
**A:** The "Source of Truth" refers to your collection of documentation artifacts. These documents are the blueprints that guide the project. When you need to make a change or add a feature, you update the relevant artifact first, and then use that updated plan to instruct the AI on what code to write.

### Q: What is the "Perfect Loop" workflow?
**A:** The "Perfect Loop" is the guided workflow within the Parallel Co-Pilot Panel. The UI uses a subtle blue glow to highlight the next logical step you should take, guiding you from parsing responses, to selecting one, creating a baseline, accepting files, and finally preparing the context for your next cycle.

## III. The File Tree View (FTV) / Context Chooser

### Q: What is the main purpose of the File Tree View?
**A:** The File Tree View (also known as the Context Chooser) is the heart of Phase 1 of the DCE. It replaces the tedious and error-prone process of manually listing files for your AI's context. You can use the checkboxes to intuitively select exactly which files and folders should be included when you generate your `flattened_repo.md` file.

### Q: What do the numbers next to the files and folders mean?
**A:** These are live statistics to help you manage your context size. For each file and folder, you can see the total number of files it contains and its approximate token count. This helps you quickly identify which parts of your project are the largest and make informed decisions about what to include.

### Q: Can I save a set of selected files?
**A:** Yes. You can save your current selection of checked files as a named "Selection Set." This is useful when you are working on multiple features that require different contexts. You can quickly load these sets later without having to manually re-select all the files.

## IV. The Parallel Co-Pilot Panel (PCPP)

### Q: Why use a "Parallel" Co-Pilot?
**A:** Relying on a single AI response can be risky. The PCPP is designed to manage multiple, parallel responses to the same prompt. This allows you to compare different solutions from an AI, see how it approaches the problem in various ways, and select the best possible implementation.

### Q: What does "Parse All" do?
**A:** When you paste raw AI responses into the tabs, they are just plain text. Clicking "Parse All" instructs the DCE to read the content in every tab and structure it. The extension looks for specific tags (like `<summary>` and `<file path="...">`) to separate the AI's plan from its code, enabling features like syntax highlighting and file diffing.

### Q: What is the "Associated Files" list?
**A:** After parsing, this list shows all the files that the AI's response intends to create or modify. It includes a checkmark (`✓`) or an 'x' (`✗`) to show you if that file already exists in your workspace. This is a quick way to spot if the AI is hallucinating file paths or suggesting new files.

### Q: How does the "Accept Selected" button work?
**A:** This is a key part of the workflow. After you check the boxes next to the files you want in the "Associated Files" list, clicking "Accept Selected" will write the AI-generated code from the response directly into your workspace files, overwriting their current content.

### Q: What do the "Baseline" and "Restore" buttons do?
**A:** These buttons integrate with Git to create a safe testing loop.
*   **Baseline (Commit):** Creates a Git commit of your current workspace state, giving you a safe restore point.
*   **Restore Baseline:** Reverts all changes made since the last baseline, including deleting any newly created files. This allows you to quickly undo an AI's changes if they don't work and test a different response.

## V. Troubleshooting

### Q: Why is the File Tree View (FTV) flashing or constantly refreshing?
**A:** This is almost always caused by the extension's auto-save feature interacting with a file watcher. Ensure that the `.vscode/` directory is added to your project's `.gitignore` file. This tells the file watcher to ignore changes to the DCE's own history file, which prevents the refresh loop.

### Q: I'm seeing duplicate files in my `flattened_repo.md`. Why?
**A:** This can happen if the selection state becomes desynchronized, often related to the "Automatically add new files to selection" feature. The quickest fix is to use the "Deselect All Across all Responses" button in the PCPP or to manually clear the "Selected Items" list in the FTV, and then re-select your files.

### Q: My estimated prompt cost is always $0.00. Is it broken?
**A:** This was a bug that has been fixed. The cost calculation should now trigger correctly whenever a cycle is loaded or its context is changed. If it's still showing zero, try clicking the "Log State" button in the PCPP header and review the output logs for any calculation errors.
