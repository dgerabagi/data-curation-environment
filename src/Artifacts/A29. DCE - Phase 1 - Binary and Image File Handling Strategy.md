# Artifact A29: DCE - Phase 1 - Binary and Image File Handling Strategy
# Date Created: C46
# Author: AI Model
# Updated on: C47 (Richer metadata format and JSON output)

- **Key/Value for A0:**
- **Description:** Defines the strategy for handling binary files; they can be checked, but only their metadata (path, size) is included in the flattened output, not their content.
- **Tags:** feature plan, binary, image, metadata, flatten, phase 1

## 1. Overview & Goal

During beta testing, a use case emerged for including information about binary files (like images) in the flattened context without including their raw, unreadable content. The goal of this strategy is to allow users to select *any* file, but to intelligently handle non-text files during the flattening process to prevent corrupting the output while still capturing useful metadata.

## 2. Problem Statement

-   **Initial Problem:** Flattening a folder containing images (`.png`, `.gif`) resulted in binary gibberish being written to `flattened_repo.md`.
-   **Initial Solution (C43):** Prevent selection of binary files by disabling their checkboxes.
-   **Refined Requirement (C46):** The user realized they *do* want to capture the existence and properties of these files (e.g., path, size) as part of the context, just not their content.
-   **Refined Requirement (C47):** The metadata should be richer, including name, directory, dimensions, and file type, and be presented in a structured format.

## 3. The New Strategy

The extension will now adopt a "metadata-only" approach for a predefined list of binary and image file types.

### 3.1. User Experience

1.  **Selection is Always Allowed:** All files in the file tree, regardless of type, will have an enabled checkbox. The user is free to check any file or folder.
2.  **File Opening:** Clicking on any file in the tree view will open it using VS Code's default viewer for that file type (e.g., text editor for `.ts`, image preview for `.png`).
3.  **Flattening Behavior is Differentiated:**
    *   When a **text file** is checked and the "Flatten Context" button is pressed, its full content is read and included in `flattened_repo.md`.
    *   When a **binary or image file** is checked, its content is **not** read. Instead, the flattener service will gather its metadata and include a structured, human-readable entry for it in `flattened_repo.md`.

### 3.2. Output Format for Binary Files

When a binary file is included, its entry in the `<files content>` section of `flattened_repo.md` will contain a `<metadata>` tag with a JSON object. Dimensions will be included on a best-effort basis for common formats (PNG, JPG, GIF).

**Example (with dimensions):**
```xml
<file path="public/images/logo.png">
<metadata>
{
  "name": "logo.png",
  "directory": "public/images",
  "fileType": "PNG",
  "sizeInBytes": 12345,
  "dimensions": {
    "width": 256,
    "height": 256
  }
}
</metadata>
</file>
```

**Example (without dimensions):**
```xml
<file path="assets/archive.zip">
<metadata>
{
  "name": "archive.zip",
  "directory": "assets",
  "fileType": "ZIP",
  "sizeInBytes": 102400
}
</metadata>
</file>
```

## 4. Technical Implementation Plan

1.  **File Opening (`fs.service.ts`):**
    *   The `handleOpenFileRequest` method will be updated to use `vscode.commands.executeCommand('vscode.open', uri)`. This delegates opening to VS Code, which correctly selects the appropriate viewer for any file type.

2.  **Backend Flattener Logic (`flattener.service.ts`):**
    *   A constant set of binary/image extensions will be defined.
    *   A new private method, `_parseImageMetadata`, will be added. It will read a file's buffer and attempt to parse dimensions for PNG, JPG, and GIF files, adapting logic from `flattenv2.js`.
    *   The `getFileStatsAndContent` method will be updated. When it encounters a binary file, it will:
        *   Call `_parseImageMetadata`.
        *   Collect the name, directory, type, size, and (if available) dimensions.
        *   Construct the formatted JSON string.
        *   Return a `FileStats` object where `content` is this JSON string, and `tokens` is 0.
