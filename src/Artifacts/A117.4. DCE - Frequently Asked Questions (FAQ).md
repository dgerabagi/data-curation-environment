## 1. General Concepts

### Q: What is the Data Curation Environment (DCE)?
**A:** The Data Curation Environment (DCE) is a VS Code extension designed to streamline and accelerate AI-assisted software development. It provides a suite of tools to help you precisely select and manage the code and documents (the "context") you provide to a Large Language Model (LLM), and to efficiently review, test, and integrate the AI's generated responses.

### Q: What problem does DCE solve?
**A:** DCE solves the "context problem" in AI development. Manually copying and pasting code into an AI chat is inefficient, error-prone, and doesn't scale for complex tasks. DCE replaces this with a structured, repeatable, and powerful workflow directly inside your code editor, transforming your development process into a series of auditable "cycles."

### Q: What is the core workflow of DCE?
**A:** The DCE workflow is an iterative loop:
1.  **Curate Context:** Use the File Tree View (FTV) to select the relevant files and folders for your task.
2.  **Generate Prompt:** Click "Generate prompt.md" to package your context, project history, and instructions into a single file.
3.  **Get AI Responses:** Copy the content of `prompt.md` and paste it into your preferred AI (like Gemini, Claude, or ChatGPT) to get multiple solutions.
4.  **Review & Compare:** Paste the AI's responses into the Parallel Co-Pilot Panel (PCPP) to parse, compare, and diff them side-by-side.
5.  **Test & Accept:** Use the Git-integrated "Baseline" and "Restore" features to safely test an AI's proposed code. Once satisfied, "Accept" the changes into your workspace.
6.  **Start New Cycle:** Write notes for the next task and repeat the process.

### Q: What is a "Cycle"?
**A:** A "Cycle" in DCE represents one complete turn of the development loop—from writing a prompt to receiving and integrating an AI response. The extension saves your work for each cycle, creating a persistent and navigable history of your project's evolution.

## 2. Installation & Setup

### Q: How do I install the DCE extension?
**A:** The DCE extension is installed from a `.vsix` file. You can install it by going to the Extensions view in VS Code (Ctrl+Shift+X), clicking the "..." menu, and selecting "Install from VSIX...".

### Q: What are the prerequisites?
**A:** You need to have Visual Studio Code and `git` installed on your machine. The extension works best when your project is a Git repository, as this enables the powerful "Baseline" and "Restore" features.

### Q: How do I start a new project with DCE?
**A:** Simply open a new, empty folder in VS Code. The DCE will automatically detect that it's a new project and present you with the "Onboarding" view. Just describe your project's goals in the text box and click "Generate Initial Artifacts Prompt" to begin the process.

## 3. Features: Context Curation (File Tree View)

### Q: What is the "File Tree View" (FTV)?
**A:** The FTV is the main panel for context curation, accessible via the spiral icon in the activity bar. It shows your entire workspace as a file tree with checkboxes, allowing you to select files and folders to be included in your prompt.

### Q: What does "Flatten Context" do?
**A:** The "Flatten Context" button takes all the files you have checked in the FTV, reads their content, and combines them into a single `flattened_repo.md` file. This file is then used as part of the `prompt.md` sent to the AI.

### Q: What is the "Selected Items" panel?
**A:** This panel at the bottom of the FTV shows a list of all individual files that are currently checked. It's a great way to review your selection and see which files are contributing the most tokens. You can also sort this list and remove items in batches.

### Q: What does "Automatically add new files to selection" do?
**A:** When this option is enabled, any new file created in your workspace will be automatically checked and added to your selection. This is useful when you are actively developing and want to ensure new work is included in the next AI prompt.

## 4. Features: Parallel Co-Pilot Panel (PCPP)

### Q: What is the Parallel Co-Pilot Panel (PCPP)?
**A:** The PCPP is the multi-tabbed environment where you manage AI responses. You can open it using the `DCE: Open Parallel Co-Pilot` command or by clicking the icon in the FTV header.

### Q: How do I use the response tabs?
**A:** You can paste a different AI-generated response into each "Resp #" tab. This allows you to keep multiple potential solutions organized in one place.

### Q: What does the "Parse All" button do?
**A:** After you paste raw responses into the tabs, clicking "Parse All" instructs the DCE to read the content in every tab and structure it. It separates the AI's summary and plan from the code files, displays a list of "Associated Files," and enables syntax highlighting and diffing.

### Q: What are "Associated Files"?
**A:** This is a list of all the files that the AI's response intends to create or modify. The DCE shows you a `✓` if the file exists in your project and an `✗` if it doesn't, helping you spot new files or AI "hallucinations."

### Q: How do I see the changes an AI is proposing?
**A:** After parsing, you can simply click on any file in the "Associated Files" list. This will open a diff view that shows a side-by-side comparison of your current file and the AI's suggested version.

### Q: What do "Baseline (Commit)" and "Restore Baseline" do?
**A:** These buttons provide a safe way to test AI code.
*   **Baseline (Commit):** Creates a `git commit` of your project in its current state, saving a safe restore point.
*   **Restore Baseline:** Reverts all changes in your workspace back to the last baseline you created. This is perfect for undoing an AI's changes if they don't work as expected.

### Q: What does "Accept Selected" do?
**A:** In the "Associated Files" list, you can check the box next to each file whose changes you want to apply. Clicking "Accept Selected" will overwrite the files in your workspace with the AI-generated versions for only the files you have checked.

## 5. Local LLM / Demo Mode

### Q: What is "Demo Mode"?
**A:** "Demo Mode" is a setting that configures the DCE to connect to a pre-configured local Large Language Model (LLM) instead of requiring you to manually copy and paste. When in this mode, the "Generate prompt.md" button is replaced with a "Generate responses" button that automates the entire process.

### Q: Can I connect DCE to my own local LLM?
**A:** Yes. The settings panel allows you to switch from "Manual" or "Demo" mode to "API (URL)" mode. Here, you can enter the endpoint URL for your own local LLM (e.g., one running via Ollama, LM Studio, or vLLM), as long as it exposes an OpenAI-compatible API.

## 6. Troubleshooting

### Q: My `prompt.md` seems stale and isn't including my latest notes. What's wrong?
**A:** Make sure you are clicking the "Generate prompt.md" button from the correct cycle. The prompt is generated based on the cycle you are currently viewing. Also, ensure your "Cycle Title" and "Cycle Context" fields are filled out, as this is a prerequisite for generating the prompt for the next cycle.

### Q: Parsing failed or looks incorrect. What can I do?
**A:** Parsing failures can happen if the AI doesn't format its response correctly. You can click "Un-Parse All" to return to the raw text view. Often, you can fix the issue by manually adding a missing tag (like `<summary>...</summary>`) or correcting a malformed file tag (`<file path="...">...
