# Artifact A[XX]: [Project Name] - Universal Task Checklist
# Date Created: C[XX]
# Author: AI Model & Curator
# Updated on: C10 (Add guidance for planning next cycle)

- **Key/Value for A0:**
- **Description:** A generic template for a universal task checklist, designed to organize work by file and complexity.
- **Tags:** template, process, checklist, task management, planning

## 1. Purpose

This artifact provides a structured, universal format for tracking development tasks, feedback, and bugs. Unlike cycle-specific trackers, this checklist organizes work by the group of files involved in a given task. It also introduces a simple complexity metric based on the total token count of the affected files and an estimation of whether the task will require more than one development cycle to complete.

This file-centric approach helps in planning and prioritizing work, especially in an AI-assisted development workflow where context size (token count) is a primary constraint.

## 2. How to Use

-   **Group by File Packages:** Create a new `##` section for each logical task or feature. List all the files that are expected to be modified for this task.
-   **Assign an ID:** Give each task package a unique, simple ID (e.g., `T-1`, `T-2`) for easy reference in feedback.
-   **Estimate Complexity:**
    -   Calculate the **Total Tokens** for all files in the package. This gives a quantitative measure of the context size.
    -   Estimate if the task is likely to take **More than one cycle?**. This is a qualitative judgment based on the complexity of the changes required.
-   **List Action Items:** Under each file package, create a checklist of specific actions, bugs to fix, or features to implement.
-   **Add Verification Steps:** After the action items, add a section describing how the curator should test the feature to confirm it is working as expected.
-   **Note on Output Length:** Remember that the maximum output length for a single response is approximately 65,000 tokens. Do not prematurely stop generating files; attempt to complete as many full files as possible within this limit.
-   **Plan for the Future:** Always conclude your task list with a final task to create the checklist for the next cycle (e.g., `T-X: Create A[XX+1] Universal Task Checklist for Cycle [Y+]`). This creates a continuous planning loop.
-   **Keep it Current:** At the beginning of each new cycle, review and update this checklist. Move completed tasks to a "Completed" section, add new tasks based on feedback, and re-prioritize as needed. This ensures the checklist remains a living, accurate reflection of the project's status.

## Example Task List

## T-1: [Feature Name or Bug Area]
- **Files Involved:**
    - `src/path/to/fileA.ts`
    - `src/path/to/fileB.tsx`
- **Total Tokens:** [e.g., ~5,500]
- **More than one cycle?** [e.g., No]

- [ ] **Task (T-ID: 1.1):** [Description of the first action item]
- [ ] **Bug Fix (T-ID: 1.2):** [Description of the bug to be fixed]

### Verification Steps
1.  [First verification step]
2.  **Expected:** [Expected outcome of the first step]
3.  [Second verification step]
4.  **Expected:** [Expected outcome of the second step]

## T-2: Plan for Next Cycle
- **Files Involved:**
    - `src/Artifacts/A[XX+1]-New-Checklist.md`
- **Total Tokens:** [e.g., ~500]
- **More than one cycle?** No

- [ ] **Task (T-ID: 2.1):** Create the Universal Task Checklist for the next cycle based on current progress and backlog.
