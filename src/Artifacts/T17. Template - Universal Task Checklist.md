# Artifact T17: Template - Universal Task Checklist
# Date Created: C165
# Author: AI Model & Curator

- **Key/Value for A0:**
- **Description:** A generic template for a universal checklist for organizing tasks based on the files involved and the estimated complexity.
- **Tags:** template, cycle 0, process, tracking, tasks, checklist

## 1. Purpose

This artifact provides a structured, universal format for tracking development tasks, feedback, and bugs. Unlike cycle-specific trackers, this checklist organizes work by the group of files involved in a given task. It also introduces a simple complexity metric based on the total token count of the affected files and an estimation of whether the task will require more than one development cycle to complete.

This file-centric approach helps in planning and prioritizing work, especially in an AI-assisted development workflow where context size (token count) is a primary constraint.

## 2. How to Use

-   **Group by File Packages:** Create a new `##` section for each logical task or feature. List all the files that are expected to be modified for this task.
-   **Estimate Complexity:**
    -   Calculate the **Total Tokens** for all files in the package. This gives a quantitative measure of the context size.
    -   Estimate if the task is likely to take **More than one cycle?**. This is a qualitative judgment based on the complexity of the changes required.
-   **List Action Items:** Under each file package, create a checklist of specific actions, bugs to fix, or features to implement.
