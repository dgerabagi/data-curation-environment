- **Key/Value for A0:**
- **Description:** A generic template for a universal task checklist, designed to organize work by file and complexity.
- **Tags:** template, process, checklist, task management, planning

## 1. Purpose

This artifact serves as a dynamic checklist to track and organize development tasks for a given cycle. It groups tasks by the primary file(s) they affect, which provides a clear view of the workload for each part of the codebase. "Complexity" is a rough estimate based on the total token count of the involved files and the anticipated number of development cycles required to complete the task. A task that takes more than one cycle is considered complex.

## 2. Current Cycle Task List

### I. Core Logic & Services (`src/backend/services/`)

| File(s) | Task | Complexity (Tokens / Cycles) | Status | Notes |
| :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- |
| `[filename.service.ts]` | [Brief, actionable description of the task.] | [e.g., Low (~2k / 1)] | [e.g., To Do, In Progress, Complete] | [e.g., Requires a new IPC channel.] |

### II. Frontend Components (`src/client/components/`)

| File(s) | Task | Complexity (Tokens / Cycles) | Status | Notes |
| :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- |
| `[MyComponent.tsx]` | [Brief, actionable description of the task.] | [e.g., Medium (~4k / 1-2)] | [e.g., To Do, In Progress, Complete] | [e.g., Blocked by backend changes.] |

### III. Frontend Views (`src/client/views/`)

| File(s) | Task | Complexity (Tokens / Cycles) | Status | Notes |
| :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- |
| `[main.view.tsx]` | [Brief, actionable description of the task.] | [e.g., High (~8k / 2+)] | [e.g., To Do, In Progress, Complete] | [e.g., This is a major UI refactor.] |

### IV. Documentation (`src/Artifacts/`)

| File(s) | Task | Complexity (Tokens / Cycles) | Status | Notes |
| :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- |
| `[AXX. artifact-name.md]` | [Brief, actionable description of the task.] | N/A | [e.g., To Do, In Progress, Complete] | [e.g., Align documentation with new feature.] |
