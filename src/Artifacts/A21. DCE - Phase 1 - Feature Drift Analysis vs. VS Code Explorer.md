- **Key/Value for A0:**
- **Description:** A comparative analysis documenting the functional and behavioral differences between the DCE custom file view and the native VS Code Explorer to guide future development and feature parity.
- **Tags:** feature plan, analysis, drift, ux, vs code explorer, parity

## 1. Overview & Goal

The primary goal of the Data Curation Environment (DCE) is to enhance, not replace, the core developer workflow. To minimize friction and maximize adoption, its custom file view must achieve a high degree of feature parity with the native VS Code Explorer. This document analyzes the "drift," or the set of features present in the native Explorer that are currently missing from the DCE view. This analysis will serve as a backlog and prioritization guide for future development cycles.

## 3. High-Priority Features for Future Cycles

Based on the analysis, the following features represent the most significant gaps in user experience and should be prioritized:

1.  **Undo / Redo (Ctrl+Z):** The ability to undo a file move or deletion is a fundamental expectation for any file manager and its absence is a major point of friction.
2.  **Cut / Copy / Paste:** Adding standard clipboard operations for files is a key missing piece of basic file management.
3.  **Expanded Context Menu:** Adding more of the native right-click options, especially `Open in Integrated Terminal` and `Compare Selected`, would significantly reduce the need for users to switch back to the native Explorer.
