# Date Created: C28
# Author: AI Model
# Updated on: C29 (Add Git Status integration)

- **Key/Value for A0:**
- **Description:** A comparative analysis documenting the functional and behavioral differences between the DCE custom file view and the native VS Code Explorer to guide future development and feature parity.
- **Tags:** feature plan, analysis, drift, ux, vs code explorer, parity

## 1. Overview & Goal

The primary goal of the Data Curation Environment (DCE) is to enhance, not replace, the core developer workflow. To minimize friction and maximize adoption, its custom file view must achieve a high degree of feature parity with the native VS Code Explorer. This document analyzes the "drift," or the set of features present in the native Explorer that are currently missing from the DCE view. This analysis will serve as a backlog and prioritization guide for future development cycles.

## 3. High-Priority Features for Future Cycles

Based on the analysis, the following features represent the most significant gaps in user experience and should be prioritized:

1.  **Git Status Integration:** Providing visual cues (colors, letters like 'U' or 'M') for the Git status of files is a massive quality-of-life improvement that provides essential context at a glance.
2.  **Drag and Drop:** The ability to move files and folders by dragging them is a core, intuitive part of any file explorer. While technically complex to implement in a webview, its absence is a major point of friction.
3.  **Keyboard Navigation:** Power users rely heavily on keyboard navigation (arrow keys to move, Enter to open/expand, Space to select). The lack of this makes the DCE feel incomplete.
4.  **Expanded Context Menu:** Adding more of the native right-click options, especially `Open in Integrated Terminal` and `Compare Selected`, would significantly reduce the need for users to switch back to the native Explorer.
5.  **Filtering:** The ability to start typing to filter the tree is a major productivity feature in the native explorer.

By systematically addressing this drift, we can make the DCE an indispensable and seamless part of the developer's toolkit.
