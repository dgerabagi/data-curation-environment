## 1. Overview

This document outlines the technical implementation strategy for the Parallel Co-Pilot Panel. It involves creating a new, dedicated webview and the associated backend services to manage its state and perform file operations.

## 2. Core Components

### 2.1. New Webview Provider

*   A new view will be registered in `package.json` and a new view provider will be created, similar to the existing `context-chooser.view`.
*   **Location:** `src/client/views/parallel-copilot.view/`
*   **Entry:** It will have its own `view.tsx` entry point to render the React application.

### 2.2. Frontend State Management (`view.tsx`)

The main state for the webview will be an array of objects, where each object represents a tab.

```typescript
interface TabState {
  id: number;
  content: string;
  sourceFilePath: string | null;
  originalSourceContent: string | null; // Stores the original file content after the first swap
  metadata: {
    lines: number;
    tokens: number;
    similarity: number;
  };
}

const [tabs, setTabs] = useState<TabState[]>([]);
```

*   The number of items in the `tabs` array will be controlled by the UI slider.
*   The `sourceFilePath` will need to be set by the user, perhaps via a text input or a "Use Active File" button.

### 2.3. IPC Communication

New channels will be required to handle the core functionality.

*   `ClientToServerChannel.RequestFileContent`:
    *   **Payload:** `{ path: string }`
    *   **Action:** Frontend requests the content of a source file from the backend to calculate original metadata.
*   `ClientToServerChannel.RequestSwapFileContent`:
    *   **Payload:** `{ path: string, newContent: string }`
    *   **Action:** Frontend requests the backend to perform the "swap" operation.
*   `ServerToClientChannel.SendFileContent`:
    *   **Payload:** `{ path: string, content: string }`
    *   **Action:** Backend sends the requested file content back to the frontend.

### 2.4. Backend Logic (`fs.service.ts`)

New handlers will be added to `FSService` to support the webview's needs.

1.  **`handleRequestFileContent`:**
    *   Receives a file path.
    *   Reads the file using `vscode.workspace.fs.readFile`.
    *   Returns the content via the `SendFileContent` IPC channel.

2.  **`handleSwapFileContentRequest`:**
    *   This is the core of the "swap" feature.
    *   **Input:** `{ path: string, newContent: string }`.
    *   **Steps:**
        1.  Reads the current content of the file at `path` into a variable (`originalContent`).
        2.  Writes `newContent` to the file at `path` using `vscode.workspace.fs.writeFile`.
        3.  Returns `originalContent` to the frontend via the `SendFileContent` channel.
    *   This single, atomic operation ensures the swap is clean and the original content is immediately sent back to be stored in the tab.

### 2.5. Similarity Scoring

*   A lightweight string similarity library will be needed on the frontend.
*   **Recommendation:** `string-similarity` (uses Dice's Coefficient) or a similar small library.
*   A utility function will be created: `calculateSimilarity(stringA, stringB): number`.
*   This calculation will be performed in the frontend whenever the content of a tab or the original source file changes. The result will be stored in the tab's state.
