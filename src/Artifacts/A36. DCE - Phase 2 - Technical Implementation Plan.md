## 1. Overview

This document outlines the technical implementation strategy for the Parallel Co-Pilot Panel. The plan is updated to reflect several UI/UX fixes and new features from recent cycles.

## 2. Core Components

### 2.1. Frontend State Management (`view.tsx`)

The component state will be expanded to manage the new UI features.

```typescript
// State within the view.tsx component
interface PcppState {
  // ... existing state
  selectedFilesForReplacement: Set<string>; // This state must be persisted per-cycle
  fileExistenceMap: Map<string, boolean>;
}```
*   **`selectedFilesForReplacement`**: This state must be explicitly cleared when the user navigates to a new or different cycle to prevent "state bleeding." It must also be saved as part of the `PcppCycle` object.
*   **`fileExistenceMap`**: This state must be updated after a file is successfully created via the "Accept" functionality to provide immediate UI feedback.

### 2.2. Robust "New Cycle" Button Logic

*   **Goal:** The `[ + ]` (New Cycle) button must be disabled until all required precursor data from the *previous* cycle is present.
*   **Implementation (`view.tsx`):** The `isNewCycleButtonDisabled` memoized boolean will be updated. It must now check:
    1.  That the `cycleTitle` of the *current* cycle is non-default and not empty.
    2.  That the `cycleContext` of the *current* cycle is not empty.
    3.  That a `selectedResponseId` has been set for the *current* cycle.
    *   This ensures that a user cannot create an orphaned "Cycle 2" before they have finished providing all the necessary inputs for "Cycle 1".

### 2.3. Clearing Selection State on Navigation
*   **Goal:** Fix the bug where checked files from one cycle remain checked when viewing another cycle.
*   **Implementation (`view.tsx`):** The `handleCycleChange` and `handleNewCycle` functions will explicitly reset the `selectedFilesForReplacement` state to `new Set()` on every navigation.

### 2.4. IPC Channel Updates

*   **`ServerToClientChannel.FilesWritten`:** A channel to provide direct feedback from the backend to the PCPP frontend after a file write operation.
*   **`RequestLogState`:** A channel to facilitate the "Log State" feature.

### 2.5. Backend State Synchronization (`file-operation.service.ts`, `on-message.ts`)

*   **Goal:** Fix the UI desynchronization bug where a newly created file still shows a red `✗`.
*   **Implementation:** The `handleBatchFileWrite` method in `file-operation.service.ts` will return the paths of successfully written files. The `on-message.ts` handler will then send a `FilesWritten` message back to the frontend, which will update its `fileExistenceMap` state.

### 2.6. Backend State Logging (`prompt.service.ts`)

*   **Goal:** Implement the logic for the "Log State" button.
*   **Implementation:** A new method, `generateStateLog`, will be added to `PromptService`. It will receive the frontend state, construct a comprehensive log message including a JSON dump and the generated `<M6. Cycles>` block, and send it to the `LoggerService`.
