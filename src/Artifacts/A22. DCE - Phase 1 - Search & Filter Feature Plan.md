## 1. Overview & Goal

To improve navigation and usability in large projects, this feature introduces a search and filter capability to the Data Curation Environment. The goal is to allow users to quickly find specific files or folders by typing a part of their name, mirroring the incremental filtering behavior of the native VS Code Explorer.

## 2. User Story

| ID | User Story | Acceptance Criteria |
|---|---|---|
| SF-01 | **Filter File Tree** | As a user working in a large repository, I want to type in a search bar to filter the file tree in real-time, so I can quickly locate the files and folders I need without extensive scrolling. | - A search icon/button is present in the main header toolbar. <br> - Clicking the icon reveals a text input field. <br> - As I type into the input field, the file tree dynamically updates to show only the files and folders whose names match the search string. <br> - All parent directories of a matching file are also shown to preserve the tree structure. <br> - The search is case-insensitive. <br> - Clearing the search input restores the full, unfiltered tree. |

## 3. Technical Implementation Plan

1.  **Frontend - UI (`view.tsx`, `view.scss`):**
    *   Add a new state variable to the main `App` component: `const [filterTerm, setFilterTerm] = useState('');`.
    *   Add a search icon (`VscSearch`) to the header toolbar. A second state, `isSearchVisible`, can be used to toggle the visibility of the input field when the icon is clicked.
    *   The search `<input>` element's `value` will be bound to `filterTerm`, and its `onChange` handler will call `setFilterTerm`.

2.  **Frontend - Filtering Logic (`FileTree.tsx`):**
    *   The `FileTree` component will receive the `filterTerm` as a new prop.
    *   A `useMemo` hook will be used to compute the filtered tree whenever the source `data` or the `filterTerm` changes.
    *   This hook will call a new recursive filtering function:
        ```typescript
        function filterTree(nodes: FileNode[], term: string): FileNode[] {
            if (!term) return nodes;
            const lowerCaseTerm = term.toLowerCase();

            return nodes.reduce((acc, node) => {
                if (node.name.toLowerCase().includes(lowerCaseTerm)) {
                    // If the node itself matches, include it and all its children
                    acc.push(node);
                    return acc;
                }

                if (node.children) {
                    // If the node is a directory, filter its children
                    const filteredChildren = filterTree(node.children, term);
                    if (filteredChildren.length > 0) {
                        // If any children match, include the parent with its filtered children
                        acc.push({ ...node, children: filteredChildren });
                    }
                }
                return acc;
            }, [] as FileNode[]);
        }
        ```
    *   The `TreeView` component will then be rendered with this new, filtered data.

3.  **State Management:**
    *   The filtering is a pure frontend operation. No backend changes or IPC communication are required for this feature.
    *   The search term is transient UI state and does not need to be persisted.
