## **I. General Questions**

### **Q: What is the Data Curation Environment (DCE)?**

**A:** The Data Curation Environment (DCE) is a VS Code extension designed to streamline and enhance the workflow of AI-assisted development. It provides an integrated toolset for selecting, managing, and packaging the context (code files, documents, etc.) you provide to Large Language Models (LLMs), and for managing the multiple responses you get back.

### **Q: What problem does DCE solve?**

**A:** DCE solves the problem of "context management." Interacting effectively with an LLM requires providing it with the right information. Manually copying and pasting files, tracking which files you've included, and comparing different AI suggestions is a cumbersome and error-prone process. DCE automates this, allowing you to focus on the creative and strategic aspects of development.

### **Q: Who is DCE for?**

**A:** DCE is for any developer, researcher, or creator who uses LLMs as part of their workflow. It's particularly useful for those working on complex projects with large codebases who want a more structured and efficient way to collaborate with AI.

### **Q: What is the core philosophy behind DCE?**

**A:** The core philosophy is "Documentation First" and treating the human-AI interaction as a structured, iterative process. Before writing code, you and your AI partner should first create or update documentation artifacts that describe the plan. This ensures clarity, alignment, and creates a persistent, auditable history of the project's evolution.

## **II. Getting Started**

### **Q: How do I install the DCE extension?**

**A:** You can install the DCE extension from the Visual Studio Code Marketplace. Open VS Code, go to the Extensions view, search for "Data Curation Environment," and click "Install."

### **Q: I've installed the extension. What do I do first?**

**A:** The first step is to open a new, empty folder in VS Code. The DCE will detect that it's a new project and automatically open the Parallel Co-Pilot Panel (PCPP) to a "Welcome" screen. Here, you'll write your high-level "Project Scope."

### **Q: What is the "Project Scope"?**

**A:** The Project Scope is a natural language description of what you want to build. This is your first instruction to the AI. Once you've written it, you'll click "Generate Initial Artifacts Prompt," and the DCE will create a `prompt.md` file designed to have an AI generate your initial project documentation.

### **Q: Why does DCE create documentation first instead of code?**

**A:** This is part of the "Documentation First" philosophy. By establishing a clear plan, vision, and set of requirements in documentation artifacts, you provide a stable "source of truth" that guides all subsequent code generation. This leads to more coherent and aligned results from the AI.

### **Q: Do I need to have Git installed?**

**A:** It is highly recommended. DCE has deep integration with Git, allowing you to create "Baselines" (commits) and "Restore" your workspace with a single click. This makes it easy and safe to test AI-generated code. The extension will guide you through initializing a Git repository if you haven't already.

## **III. Core Concepts**

### **Q: What is an "Artifact"?**

**A:** In the DCE workflow, an Artifact is a formal, written document that serves as a "source of truth" for a specific part of your project. Think of them as the official blueprints, plans, and records that guide development. They are stored in the `src/Artifacts` directory.

### **Q: What are "Cycles"?**

**A:** Development in DCE is organized into "Cycles." A cycle represents a single turn of the iterative development loop: you provide context and instructions, the AI generates responses, you review and integrate a response, and then you begin the next cycle. The DCE helps you manage this history with the Cycle Navigator.

### **Q: What is "Flattening"?**

**A:** Flattening is the process of taking all the files you've selected (checked) in the File Tree View and concatenating their content into a single file, `flattened_repo.md`. This file, along with your cycle history and instructions, becomes part of the `prompt.md` that you send to the AI.

### **Q: What is the "Parallel Co-Pilot Panel" (PCPP)?**

**A:** The PCPP is the main interface of the DCE. It's a multi-tabbed panel where you can paste multiple different AI responses to the same prompt. It provides tools to parse, compare, diff, and accept the code from these responses into your workspace.

### **Q: What is "Demo Mode"?**

**A:** "Demo Mode" is a setting that allows the DCE to connect directly to a locally hosted LLM (like one running via vLLM). In this mode, instead of manually copying and pasting, you can click "Generate responses," and the DCE will automatically send the prompt and stream the responses back into the PCPP.

## **IV. Features & Workflow**

### **Q: How do I select files to include in the context for the AI?**

**A:** You use the File Tree View (FTV), which is the panel with the spiral icon. It shows your entire workspace with checkboxes next to each file and folder. Simply check the items you want to include. The FTV also shows you token counts and other useful metadata.

### **Q: What's the difference between "checking" a file and "selecting" a file?**

**A:** "Checking" a file (clicking its checkbox) adds it to the list for the "Flatten Context" operation. "Selecting" or "Highlighting" a file (clicking the file name) is for performing actions like rename, delete, or copy path from the right-click context menu.

### **Q: How do I use the Parallel Co-Pilot Panel (PCPP)?**

**A:** The typical workflow is:
1.  Generate a `prompt.md` file.
2.  Copy the content and get multiple responses from your preferred LLM.
3.  Paste each response into a separate "Resp" tab in the PCPP.
4.  Click "Parse All." The DCE will structure the responses, showing you the AI's summary, plan, and a list of "Associated Files."
5.  Review the responses. You can click on any associated file to see a diff between your current code and the AI's suggestion.
6.  Choose the best response by clicking "Select This Response."
7.  Optionally, create a Git baseline by clicking "Baseline (Commit)."
8.  Check the files you want to accept from the "Associated Files" list and click "Accept Selected."
9.  Write your notes for the next cycle in the "Cycle Context" and give it a title.
10. Click "Generate prompt.md" again to start the next cycle.

### **Q: What does the "Baseline (Commit)" button do?**

**A:** It creates a Git commit of the current state of your workspace. This gives you a safe restore point. If you accept an AI's changes and they break your code, you can simply click "Restore Baseline" to instantly revert all files to the state they were in before you accepted the changes.

### **Q: Can DCE work with local models?**

**A:** Yes. The "Demo Mode" is designed specifically for this. By selecting "API (URL)" in the settings, you can point the DCE to any OpenAI-compatible API endpoint, such as one provided by vLLM, Ollama, or LM Studio.

### **Q: Can I undo a file operation like a move or delete?**

**A:** Yes. The DCE file tree supports undo/redo (`Ctrl+Z` / `Ctrl+Y`) for file move operations performed within its view.

## **V. Troubleshooting**

### **Q: Why are some folders or files grayed out and un-selectable?**

**A:** The DCE automatically excludes common directories that shouldn't be included in an AI's context, such as `node_modules`, `.git`, `.vscode`, and build output folders like `dist`. This is to keep your context focused and to prevent errors.

### **Q: My file tree is flashing or constantly refreshing. How do I fix it?**

**A:** This is almost always caused by the DCE's auto-save feature writing to the `.vscode/dce_history.json` file, which then triggers the file watcher to refresh the tree. To fix this, you must add `.vscode/` to your project's `.gitignore` file.

### **Q: The extension is giving me an error about a command already existing on startup.**

**A:** This can happen during development or after a faulty installation. The best first step is to restart VS Code completely. If the problem persists, try reinstalling the extension.

### **Q: I'm seeing duplicate files in my `flattened_repo.md`. Why?**

**A:** This can happen due to a race condition with the "auto-add new files" feature or if the selection state becomes desynchronized. A reliable way to fix this is to go to the "Selected Items" panel in the File Tree View, select all items (`Ctrl+A`), press the `Delete` key to clear the list, and then re-check the files and folders you want from the main tree.
