## 1. Overview & Goal

The Parallel Co-Pilot Panel (PCPP) has a powerful, multi-step workflow that may not be immediately obvious to new users. The goal of this feature is to implement a guided experience using subtle UI animations. These animations will highlight the next logical action the user should take, gently guiding them through the process from project creation to generating the next cycle's prompt.

## 2. User Story

| ID | User Story | Acceptance Criteria |
|---|---|---|
| P2-WF-01 | **Guided Workflow** | As a new user, I want the UI to visually guide me through the steps of a development cycle, so I can learn the workflow intuitively. | - After a specific action is completed, the UI element for the next logical action is highlighted with a subtle animation (e.g., a pulsing blue glow). |

## 3. The Animated Workflow Sequence (The Perfect Loop)

The highlighting will follow this specific sequence of user actions:

### Onboarding / Cycle 0
1.  **Start (New Workspace):** User opens a new, empty folder in VS Code.
    *   **Auto-Action:** The **DCE Parallel Co-Pilot Panel** automatically opens.

2.  **Open PCPP (Welcome View):** The PCPP is open to the "Welcome" / "Onboarding" view.
    *   **Highlight:** The **Project Scope `textarea`** pulses.

3.  **Input Project Scope:** User types their project plan into the `textarea`.
    *   **Highlight:** The **`Generate Initial Artifacts Prompt`** button pulses.

4.  **Generate `prompt.md`:** User clicks the button. `prompt.md` and `DCE_README.md` are created. The view transitions to Cycle 1.
    *   **Auto-Action:** `prompt.md` and `src/Artifacts/DCE_README.md` are automatically opened in the editor.
    *   **Highlight:** The **`Resp 1`** tab in the PCPP pulses.

### Main Loop (Cycle 1+)
5.  **Paste Responses:** The user gets responses from an LLM and pastes them into the response tabs.
    *   **Highlight:** The highlight moves sequentially from **`Resp 1`** to **`Resp 2`**, etc., as each `textarea` is filled.
    *   **Trigger:** Once content is present in all tabs, the highlight moves to the next step.

6.  **Parse Responses:**
    *   **Highlight:** The **`Parse All`** button pulses.

7.  **Sort Responses:** User clicks `Parse All`.
    *   **Highlight:** The **`Sort`** button pulses. (Skips if already sorted).

8.  **Select a Response:** User reviews the responses.
    *   **Highlight:** The **`Select This Response`** button on each tab pulses.

9.  **Select Files for Acceptance (C134 Reorder):** User clicks `Select This Response`.
    *   **Highlight:** The "Associated Files" list panel and the **`Select All`** button within it pulse.

10. **Create Baseline (C134 Reorder):** User checks files in the "Associated Files" list.
    *   **Highlight:** The **`Baseline (Commit)`** button pulses.
    *   **State-Aware Skip:** This step is skipped if the backend reports that the Git working tree is already clean.

11. **Accept Changes:** User clicks `Baseline (Commit)`.
    *   **Highlight:** The **`Accept Selected`** button pulses.

12. **Write Context:** User clicks `Accept Selected`.
    *   **Highlight:** The **"Cycle Context"** `textarea` pulses.

13. **Write Title:** User types into the "Cycle Context" `textarea`.
    *   **Highlight:** The **"Cycle Title"** input field pulses.

14. **Generate Next Prompt:** User types a bespoke "Cycle Title".
    *   **Highlight:** The **`Generate prompt.md`** button pulses.

15. **Create New Cycle:** User clicks `Generate prompt.md`.
    *   **Highlight:** The **`[ + ]` (New Cycle)** button pulses, completing the loop and preparing for the next iteration which starts back at Step 5.
