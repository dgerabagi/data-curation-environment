## 1. Overview & Goal

This document outlines a series of user interface (UI) and user experience (UX) refinements identified during playtesting. The goal is to address layout bugs, provide better visual feedback to the user, and improve the overall professional feel of the extension. These changes focus on fixing immediate usability problems and making the extension more intuitive to operate.

## 2. User Stories & Issues

| ID | User Story / Issue | Acceptance Criteria |
|---|---|---|
| UI-01 | **Header Layout Bug** | As a user, I want the header of the "Data Curation" panel to be compact, without the extra vertical space between the title and the toolbar buttons, so it looks clean and professional. | - The vertical gap between the view title row and the toolbar button row is removed. <br> - The header area takes up minimal vertical space. <br> - This is a CSS fix, likely involving adjusting `padding`, `margin`, or `gap` in the flex container. |
| UI-02 | **"Selected Items" Overflow Bug** | As a user, when I select many files, I want the "Selected Items" list to scroll within its panel instead of running off the screen behind the "Flatten Context" footer, so I can see and manage all my selections. | - The "Selected Items" panel has a defined `max-height`. <br> - When the content exceeds this height, a vertical scrollbar appears. <br> - The panel never overlaps or pushes the footer out of view. <br> - This is a CSS fix involving `flex-grow`, `flex-shrink`, `min-height: 0` on the file tree container, and `overflow-y: auto` on the list container. |
| UI-03 | **Resizable "Selected Items" Panel** | As a user, I want to be able to vertically resize the "Selected Items" panel, so I can see more or fewer items as needed for my current task. | - A draggable handle or resizer element is added to the top border of the "Selected Items" panel. <br> - Clicking and dragging this handle adjusts the `height` or `max-height` of the panel. <br> - The main file tree above it resizes accordingly to fill the remaining space. |
| UI-04 | **Visible Loading State** | As a user, when I perform a slow action like renaming a file or refreshing the explorer, I want to see a loading indicator, so I have clear feedback that the system is working and not frozen. | - A loading state (e.g., `isLoading`) is added to the main view's state. <br> - This state is set to `true` when a file system scan begins (e.g., on initial load or refresh). <br> - A loading indicator (e.g., a spinning icon) is displayed in the UI (e.g., in the header toolbar) while `isLoading` is true. <br> - The state is set to `false` when the file data is received from the backend. |
| UI-05 | **Improved Scrollbar Gutter** | As a user, I find it difficult to distinguish between the extension's internal scrollbar and the main VS Code scrollbar when they are side-by-side. I want a clearer visual separation between them. | - A subtle vertical border (`border-right`) is added to the main file tree container. <br> - This creates a persistent, visible dividing line between the two scrollable areas, making it easier to position the mouse. |
| UI-06 | **Expand All Button** | As a user, I want an "Expand All" button in the toolbar, so I can quickly see all files in the project without manually clicking every folder. | - An "Expand All" button is added to the main header toolbar. <br> - Clicking it expands every collapsed folder in the file tree. <br> - The button complements the existing "Collapse All" button. |
| UI-07 | **Associated Files Animation Glitch** | As a user, I want the animated highlight on the "Associated Files" panel to be fully visible, so the guided workflow is clear. | - The top and left edges of the pulsing blue highlight are currently slightly obscured. <br> - A small `margin` will be added to the `.collapsible-section-inner` class to provide space for the `box-shadow` to render completely. |
