# Artifact A17: DCE - Phase 1 - Advanced Tree View Features
# Date Created: Cycle 22
# Author: AI Model

- **Key/Value for A0:**
- **Description:** Outlines the plan for advanced tree view interactions, specifically the implementation of scrollable, self-contained views for large, expanded folders.
- **Tags:** feature plan, tree view, ux, scrollable, phase 1

## 1. Overview & Goal

The current file tree view expands vertically, which can create a poor user experience when a folder containing hundreds of files is opened. The entire view becomes excessively long, forcing the user to scroll a great distance to see files or folders below the expanded one. The goal of this feature is to innovate on the traditional tree view by containing the contents of a large expanded folder within a scrollable, "inline" window, preventing the main view from becoming unmanageable.

## 2. User Story

| ID | User Story | Acceptance Criteria |
|---|---|---|
| TV-01 | **Contained Folder Expansion** | As a user, when I expand a folder with a large number of children, I want its contents to appear in a scrollable sub-panel within the tree instead of pushing all subsequent items down, so I can browse the folder's contents without losing my place in the main file tree. | - When a folder is expanded, the extension checks the number of direct children. <br> - If the child count exceeds a certain threshold (e.g., 50), the children are rendered inside a nested, scrollable `div`. <br> - This `div` has a fixed `max-height`. <br> - A small 'x' icon is visible within this sub-panel. Clicking it closes the sub-panel and reverts the folder to the standard, fully expanded view for that session. |

## 3. Technical Implementation Plan

This is a significant UI/UX enhancement and will require careful implementation within the React component hierarchy.

1.  **Component (`TreeView.tsx`):**
    *   The core logic will reside in the `renderTreeNodes` function.
    *   **Threshold Check:** When rendering a directory node, check `if (node.children && node.children.length > FOLDER_CONTENT_THRESHOLD)`. The threshold will be a configurable constant.
    *   **State Management:** A new state variable will be needed to track which "large" folders have been reverted to the standard view by the user clicking the 'x' button. `const [standardViewFolders, setStandardViewFolders] = useState<Set<string>>(new Set());`
    *   **Conditional Rendering:**
        *   If the folder is expanded (`isExpanded`) AND its path is **not** in `standardViewFolders` AND it exceeds the threshold, render the children inside a special container:
            ```jsx
            <div className="large-folder-container" style={{ maxHeight: '300px', overflowY: 'auto' }}>
              <button onClick={() => setStandardViewFolders(prev => new Set(prev).add(node.absolutePath))}>X</button>
              <ul>{renderTreeNodes(node.children)}</ul>
            </div>
            ```
        *   Otherwise, render the children normally as is currently done:
            ```jsx
            <ul className="treenode-children">{renderTreeNodes(node.children)}</ul>
            ```

2.  **Styling (`view.scss`):**
    *   Create styles for `.large-folder-container`.
    *   It will need `position: relative`, a subtle `border` or `background-color` to distinguish it from the rest of the tree.
    *   The close button will need to be positioned appropriately within the container.

3.  **Performance Considerations:**
    *   This approach avoids virtualizing the entire tree, which is much more complex. It only contains the content of single, large folders.
    *   Rendering hundreds of nodes within the scrollable container might still have a minor performance impact on initial render, but it will be contained and will not affect the performance of the main tree's scrolling.
