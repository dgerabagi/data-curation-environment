- **Key/Value for A0:**
- **Description:** Details the requirements for implementing copy-paste functionality (Ctrl+C, Ctrl+V) for files and folders within the DCE view, including handling name collisions.
- **Tags:** feature plan, copy, paste, file operations, ux, phase 1

## 1. Overview & Goal

To achieve greater feature parity with the native VS Code Explorer and improve workflow efficiency, this plan outlines the implementation of standard copy-paste functionality for files and folders. Users expect to be able to use `Ctrl+C` and `Ctrl+V` to duplicate items within the file tree. The goal is to provide this intuitive and essential file management feature, complete with robust handling of name collisions to prevent accidental file overwrites.

## 2. User Stories

| ID | User Story | Acceptance Criteria |
|---|---|---|
| CP-01 | **Copy and Paste File/Folder** | As a user, I want to select a file or folder, press `Ctrl+C`, then select a destination folder and press `Ctrl+V` to create a duplicate, so I can quickly copy assets or boilerplate code within my project. | - `Ctrl+C` on a focused file/folder in the DCE view copies its path to an internal clipboard. <br> - `Ctrl+V` pastes the copied item into the currently focused folder. <br> - If a file is focused, the paste occurs in its parent directory. <br> - Pasting a folder also copies its entire contents recursively. |
| CP-02 | **Handle Name Collisions** | As a user, when I paste a file named `file.txt` into a folder that already contains a `file.txt`, I expect the new file to be automatically renamed to `file-copy.txt` (or similar), so I don't accidentally overwrite my work. | - If a file with the same name exists at the destination, the pasted file is renamed. <br> - The renaming scheme is `[original]-copy.[ext]`. <br> - If `[original]-copy.[ext]` also exists, the scheme becomes `[original]-copy-2.[ext]`, `[original]-copy-3.[ext]`, and so on, until a unique name is found. <br> - This applies to both files and folders. |

## 3. Technical Implementation Plan

1.  **IPC Channels (`channels.enum.ts`, `channels.type.ts`):**
    *   Create a new `ClientToServerChannel.RequestCopyFile` channel.
    *   The payload will be `{ sourcePath: string; destinationDir: string; }`.

2.  **Frontend State & Logic (`view.tsx`, `TreeView.tsx`):**
    *   **Clipboard State (`view.tsx`):** Add a new state variable to the main `App` component to act as the internal clipboard: `const [clipboard, setClipboard] = useState<{ path: string; type: 'copy' } | null>(null);`.
    *   **Keyboard Event Handler (`TreeView.tsx`):** Update the `handleKeyDown` function.
        *   It will now listen for `e.key === 'c'` and `e.key === 'v'` when `e.ctrlKey` (or `e.metaKey`) is true.
        *   **On `Ctrl+C`:** It will call a prop function (`onCopy`) passed down from `view.tsx`, which will update the `clipboard` state with the `focusedNodePath`.
        *   **On `Ctrl+V`:** It will check if the `clipboard` state is populated. If so, it will determine the destination directory from the `focusedNodePath` (if the focused node is a folder, use its path; if it's a file, use its parent's path). It will then send the `RequestCopyFile` message to the backend.

3.  **Backend File Operation (`fs.service.ts`):**
    *   **New Handler:** Create a new `async handleCopyFileRequest({ sourcePath, destinationDir })` method.
    *   **Name Collision Logic:**
        *   This handler will contain a private helper function, `private async _findAvailableCopyName(destinationPath: string): Promise<string>`.
        *   This helper will parse the `destinationPath` into its directory, base name, and extension.
        *   It will check if the original path exists using `vscode.workspace.fs.stat`.
        *   If it exists, it will enter a loop, checking for `...-copy.[ext]`, then `...-copy-2.[ext]`, `...-copy-3.[ext]`, etc., until `fs.stat` throws an `ENOENT` error, indicating a free name.
        *   It will return the first available unique path.
    *   **File Copy:** The main handler will call `_findAvailableCopyName` to get the final target path and then use `vscode.workspace.fs.copy(sourceUri, targetUri)` to perform the recursive copy.
    *   The existing file system watcher will automatically detect the new file/folder and trigger a UI refresh.
