# Artifact A82: DCE - Advanced Exclusion Management Plan
# Date Created: C6

- **Key/Value for A0:**
- **Description:** A plan for a feature allowing users to right-click files or folders and add them to a persistent exclusion list, preventing them from being automatically selected or flattened.
- **Tags:** feature plan, context menu, exclusion, ignore, ux

## 1. Overview & Goal

Users need a simple, intuitive way to manage which files are included in the Data Curation Environment's view and processes. While some files are excluded by default (e.g., `.git`), users may have project-specific directories (like `dist`, `build`, or custom log folders) that they want to permanently ignore.

The goal of this feature is to allow users to right-click any file or folder in the main file tree and add it to a persistent exclusion list, which will be stored in the workspace's settings.

## 2. User Story

| ID | User Story | Acceptance Criteria |
|---|---|---|
| P1-EX-01 | **Exclude from View** | As a developer, I want to right-click a build output directory (e.g., `dist`) and select "Add to DCE Exclusions", so it no longer appears in the Data Curation file tree and is never included in flattened contexts. | - A new "Add to DCE Exclusions" option is available in the file tree's right-click context menu. <br> - Selecting this option adds the file or folder's path to a custom setting in `.vscode/settings.json`. <br> - The file tree immediately refreshes and the excluded item (and its children) is no longer visible. |

## 3. Technical Implementation Plan

1.  **Configuration (`package.json`):**
    *   A new configuration point will be defined in the `contributes.configuration` section.
    *   This will create a new setting, `dce.files.exclude`, which will be an object similar to the native `files.exclude`.

2.  **Backend (`file-tree.service.ts`):**
    *   The file traversal logic will be updated to read this new `dce.files.exclude` setting from the workspace configuration.
    *   It will merge these user-defined patterns with the default exclusion patterns before scanning the file system.

3.  **UI & IPC:**
    *   **`ContextMenu.tsx`:** A new menu item, "Add to DCE Exclusions," will be added.
    *   **IPC:** A new IPC channel, `RequestAddToExclusions`, will be created.
    *   **Backend Handler (`settings.service.ts` - new or existing):** A new handler will receive the path to exclude. It will:
        1.  Get the current exclusion configuration object using `vscode.workspace.getConfiguration('dce')`.
        2.  Add the new path to the object (`newExclusion[path] = true`).
        3.  Update the configuration using `config.update('files.exclude', newExclusion, vscode.ConfigurationTarget.Workspace)`.
        4.  This will automatically trigger a refresh of the file tree as the configuration has changed.

This approach leverages VS Code's built-in settings infrastructure, making the exclusions persistent and easily manageable for the user.
