# Artifact A31: DCE - Phase 2 - Multimodal Content Extraction (PDF Images)
# Date Created: C49
# Author: AI Model

- **Key/Value for A0:**
- **Description:** A plan for a future feature to extract images from PDF files and use a multimodal LLM to generate rich, textual descriptions for inclusion in the context.
- **Tags:** feature plan, multimodal, image to text, pdf, llm, phase 2

## 1. Overview & Goal

Building on the PDF text extraction in Phase 1, this plan outlines a powerful Phase 2 enhancement: making the visual information within PDFs accessible to language models. Many technical papers, reports, and documents rely on diagrams, charts, and images to convey critical information. The goal of this feature is to extract these images from a PDF and use a multimodal vision-language model (VLM) to generate rich, textual descriptions. These descriptions can then be included in the flattened context, allowing an LLM to "understand" the visual elements of the document.

## 2. User Story

| ID | User Story | Acceptance Criteria |
|---|---|---|
| MM-01 | **Understand PDF Images** | As a data curator, when I include a PDF containing charts and diagrams in my context, I want the extension to generate textual descriptions of those images, so the LLM I'm prompting can reason about the visual data. | - When a PDF is processed, the extension identifies and extracts embedded images. <br> - For each extracted image, the extension sends it to a configured multimodal LLM API (e.g., Gemini). <br> - The LLM API returns a detailed textual description of the image's content. <br> - These descriptions are inserted into the virtual markdown content of the PDF at the appropriate locations (e.g., `[Image: A bar chart showing user growth from 2022 to 2024...]`). <br> - This feature can be enabled/disabled in the extension's settings to manage API costs. |

## 3. Technical Implementation Plan (High-Level)

This is a complex feature that will require new services and dependencies, likely as part of the project's Phase 2.

1.  **PDF Image Extraction Library:**
    *   **Research:** The first step is to research and select a robust Node.js library capable of extracting raw image data (e.g., as buffers) from a PDF file. `pdf-lib` or native command-line tools like `pdfimages` (wrapped in a Node.js process) are potential candidates.
    *   **Implementation:** A new method in `fs.service.ts`, `_extractImagesFromPdf(buffer)`, will be created to handle this process.

2.  **New Service: `ImageDescriptionService`:**
    *   A new backend service, `ImageDescriptionService`, will be created.
    *   This service will be responsible for communicating with a multimodal LLM provider (e.g., Google's Gemini API).
    *   It will have a method like `describeImage(imageBuffer: Buffer): Promise<string>`.
    *   This method will handle the API request, sending the image data and receiving the text description.
    *   It will require API key management, likely extending the existing settings infrastructure.

3.  **Integration with PDF Processing:**
    *   The `RequestPdfToText` handler in `fs.service.ts` will be significantly enhanced.
    *   After parsing the text with `pdf-parse`, it would ideally also call the new image extraction method.
    *   It would then iterate through the extracted images, call the `ImageDescriptionService` for each, and intelligently weave the resulting descriptions back into the main text content to create a comprehensive markdown representation of the entire PDF.
    *   This process would be computationally expensive and time-consuming, requiring clear user feedback (e.g., progress indicators) in the UI.

4.  **Configuration:**
    *   New settings will be added to `package.json` and managed via a settings service to allow the user to:
        *   Enable/disable this feature.
        *   Configure their multimodal API provider and key.
        *   Potentially set a budget or limit on the number of images to process per document.
