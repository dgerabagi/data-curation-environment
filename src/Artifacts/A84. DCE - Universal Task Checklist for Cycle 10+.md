## Task List

## T-1: Undo/Redo File Operations
- **Files Involved:**
    - `src/Artifacts/A27. DCE - Phase 1 - Undo-Redo Feature Plan.md`
    - `src/backend/services/action.service.ts`
    - `src/backend/services/file-operation.service.ts`
    - `src/client/components/tree-view/TreeView.tsx`
- **Total Tokens:** ~8,000
- **More than one cycle?** No

- [ ] **Task (T-ID: 1.1):** Implement the `ActionService` to manage undo/redo stacks.
- [ ] **Task (T-ID: 1.2):** Integrate `ActionService` with `FileOperationService` to push move/delete actions onto the stack.
- [ ] **Task (T-ID: 1.3):** Implement `Ctrl+Z` / `Ctrl+Y` keyboard shortcuts in `TreeView.tsx` to trigger undo/redo.

### Verification Steps
1.  Drag and drop a file to move it.
2.  Press `Ctrl+Z`.
3.  **Expected:** The file moves back to its original location.
4.  Press `Ctrl+Y`.
5.  **Expected:** The file moves back to the new location.

## T-2: Copy/Paste File Operations
- **Files Involved:**
    - `src/Artifacts/A33. DCE - Phase 1 - Copy-Paste Feature Plan.md`
    - `src/backend/services/file-operation.service.ts`
    - `src/client/components/tree-view/TreeView.tsx`
    - `src/client/views/context-chooser.view/view.tsx`
- **Total Tokens:** ~10,000
- **More than one cycle?** No

- [ ] **Task (T-ID: 2.1):** Implement internal clipboard state in `view.tsx`.
- [ ] **Task (T-ID: 2.2):** Implement `Ctrl+C` / `Ctrl+V` handlers in `TreeView.tsx`.
- [ ] **Task (T-ID: 2.3):** Implement backend `handleCopyFileRequest` logic in `file-operation.service.ts`, including robust name collision handling.

### Verification Steps
1.  Focus a file and press `Ctrl+C`.
2.  Focus a directory and press `Ctrl+V`.
3.  **Expected:** A copy of the file appears in the directory.
4.  Press `Ctrl+V` again in the same directory.
5.  **Expected:** A second copy appears with a modified name (e.g., `file-copy.ts`).
