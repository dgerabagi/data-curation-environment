- **Tags:** feature plan, multi-select, sorting, list view, ux, phase 1

## 1. Overview & Goal

To elevate the Data Curation Environment beyond basic functionality, this plan introduces advanced list-interaction features common in modern applications. The goal is to provide users with powerful and intuitive tools for managing their file selections, mirroring the behavior of native operating system file explorers. This includes robust multi-selection capabilities in both the main file tree and the "Selected Items" panel, and comprehensive sorting for the "Selected Items" list.

## 2. User Stories

| ID | User Story | Acceptance Criteria |
|---|---|---|
| US-01 | **"Selected Items" Multi-Selection** | As a curator, after selecting a large folder, I want to quickly remove a small group of unwanted files from the "Selected Items" list using standard Shift-click and Ctrl-click, so I don't have to uncheck them one by one in the main tree. | - Clicking a single item in the "Selected Items" list selects it and deselects all others. <br> - Ctrl-clicking an item toggles its selection state without affecting other items. <br> - Shift-clicking an item selects the range of items between the last-clicked anchor item and the current one. The anchor is set by the last non-Shift click. <br> - A "Remove Selected" button acts on all currently selected items in this list. |
| US-02 | **"Selected Items" Column Sorting** | As a curator, I want to sort the "Selected Items" list by file name or token count, so I can easily find specific files or identify the largest contributors to my context. | - The "Selected Items" panel has a header row with clickable "File" and "Tokens" labels. <br> - Clicking a column header sorts the list by that column. <br> - Clicking the same header again reverses the sort direction (ascending/descending). <br> - A visual indicator (e.g., an arrow) shows the current sort column and direction. <br> - The default, initial sort is by Token Count, descending. |
| US-03 | **"Selected Items" Multi-Layer Sorting** | As a curator, I want to apply a secondary sort, so I can group my selected files by type and then see the largest files within each group. | - The sorting mechanism supports at least two levels of sorting. <br> - The UI provides a way to define a primary and secondary sort key (e.g., Shift-clicking a second column header). <br> - The list first organizes by the primary key, then sorts items within those groups by the secondary key. For example, sort by Type (asc), then by Token Count (desc). |
| US-04 | **Main Tree Multi-Selection** | As a user, I want to select multiple files and folders in the main "Data Curation" file tree using standard OS conventions (Ctrl/Shift click), so I can perform context menu actions (like Delete) on multiple items at once. | - Standard multi-selection is implemented in the main file tree. <br> - This selection is a separate state from the checkbox state and is used for contextual actions, not for flattening. <br> - Right-clicking on any item within a multi-selected group opens a context menu that applies its actions to all selected items. <br> - **(Bug C31):** Ctrl-click is non-functional. Shift-click is inconsistent and difficult to use. |
| US-05 | **"As-Is" Sorting** | As a user, I want to be able to revert the "Selected Items" list to its default sort order, so I can see the files as they appear in the native VS Code explorer. | - A sort option for "Default" or "As-Is" is available. <br> - Selecting it sorts the items based on their original file system order (folders first, then files, all alphabetized). |

## 3. Technical Implementation Plan

1.  **`SelectedFilesView.tsx` Refactor:**
    *   **State Management:** Introduce new state variables to manage selection, sorting, and multi-selection.
        *   `const [selection, setSelection] = useState<Set<string>>(new Set());`
        *   `const [selectionAnchor, setSelectionAnchor] = useState<string | null>(null);` // For stable shift-click
        *   `const [sortConfig, setSortConfig] = useState<{ key: string; direction: 'asc' | 'desc' }[]>([{ key: 'tokenCount', direction: 'desc' }]);`
    *   **Event Handling:** Implement a comprehensive `onClick` handler for list items that inspects `event.ctrlKey` and `event.shiftKey`. A non-modifier click will set both the `selection` and the `selectionAnchor`. A shift-click will select from the `selectionAnchor` to the current item.
    *   **Sorting Logic:** The `useMemo` hook that sorts the `selectedFileNodes` prop will be updated to handle an array of `sortConfig` objects. It will perform a stable sort, iterating through the sort criteria until a non-zero comparison result is found. A new "Type" column will be added, requiring a utility to extract the file extension.

2.  **Batch Removal Logic (`FileTree.utils.ts`):**
    *   **Root Cause of C40 Bug:** The `removePathsFromSelected` function was buggy. It iterated through the list of files to remove, calling the single-item removal utility (`addRemovePathInSelectedFiles`) on each. This created a race condition where the first removal would perform a "subtractive uncheck" (e.g., removing `src` and adding back all its other children), drastically changing the selection state that subsequent iterations of the loop were relying on.
    *   **Codified Solution (C40):** The `removePathsFromSelected` function will be rewritten to be non-iterative and set-based. It will calculate the final desired state in a single pass by determining the full set of effectively selected files, removing the unwanted files from that set, and then "compressing" the remaining set of files back into the most efficient list of parent directories and individual files. This atomic approach is more robust and avoids the state mutation bug.

3.  **`FileTree.tsx` & `TreeView.tsx` (Main Tree Multi-Select):**
    *   This is a more complex task that mirrors the `SelectedFilesView` implementation but within a recursive tree structure.
    *   A new selection state for contextual actions (`const [contextSelection, setContextSelection] = useState<Set<string>>(new Set())`) will be managed at the top level (`view.tsx`).
    *   The selection state and handler functions will need to be passed down through `FileTree` to `TreeView`.
    *   **(Fix for C31):** The `handleNodeClick` event handler in `TreeView.tsx` must be corrected. The anchor for shift-click (`lastClickedPath`) must only be updated on a click *without* the Shift key pressed. The logic for Ctrl-click must be revised to correctly toggle a path's inclusion in the selection set without clearing other selections.
    *   The `onContextMenu` handler will need to be updated to check if the right-clicked node is part of the current `contextSelection` and pass the entire selection to the backend if an action is chosen.
