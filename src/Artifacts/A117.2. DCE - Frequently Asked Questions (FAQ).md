## 1. Overview

This document provides answers to frequently asked questions about the Data Curation Environment (DCE) VS Code extension. It is designed to help new and existing users understand the purpose, features, and workflow of the DCE.

## I. General Concepts

### **Q: What is the Data Curation Environment (DCE)?**

**A:** The Data Curation Environment is a VS Code extension designed to streamline and enhance the workflow of AI-assisted development. It provides an integrated toolset for selecting, managing, and packaging the "context" (code files, documents, etc.) you provide to a Large Language Model (LLM), and for managing the multiple responses you get back.

### **Q: What problem does DCE solve?**

**A:** DCE solves the problem of "context management." Modern AI development requires providing the AI with a precise and comprehensive set of files and information (the context). Manually collecting these files, copying their content, and pasting them into a prompt is tedious, error-prone, and inefficient. DCE automates this entire process, allowing you to focus on the creative and strategic aspects of development.

### **Q: Who is DCE for?**

**A:** DCE is for any developer, project manager, or technical writer who uses Large Language Models as part of their workflow. It is particularly useful for those working on complex projects with large codebases, where managing the context for the AI is a significant challenge.

### **Q: What is "Vibecoding"?**

**A:** "Vibecoding" is a term for the intuitive, conversational, and iterative process of collaborating with an AI to generate code or other content. It starts with a high-level goal or "vibe" and progressively refines it into a functional product through a human-machine partnership. DCE is the ideal tool for this workflow.

### **Q: What is the "Process as Asset" philosophy?**

**A:** This is the core idea that the *process* of developing with AI—the curated context, the prompts, the multiple AI responses, and the developer's final choice—is itself a valuable, auditable, and reusable asset. DCE is built to capture this process in a structured way through its "Cycle" system, creating a persistent knowledge graph of your project's evolution.

## II. Core Features

### **Q: What is the Context Chooser (File Tree View)?**

**A:** The Context Chooser is the panel with the spiral icon. It displays a file tree of your entire workspace with checkboxes next to every file and folder. This is the primary interface for selecting which files you want to include in the context that gets sent to the AI.

### **Q: What does the "Flatten Context" button do?**

**A:** The "Flatten Context" button takes all the files and folders you have "checked" in the Context Chooser, reads their content, and combines them into a single, formatted `flattened_repo.md` file in your project's root directory. This file is then ready to be used in your prompt.

### **Q: Can DCE handle different file types like PDFs or Excel sheets?**

**A:** Yes. DCE has built-in extractors for various file types. When you check a `.pdf`, `.docx` (Word), or `.xlsx`/`.csv` (Excel) file, DCE automatically extracts the textual content and converts it into a readable format (like Markdown for tables) to be included in the flattened context.

### **Q: What is the Parallel Co-Pilot Panel (PCPP)?**

**A:** The Parallel Co-Pilot Panel is the main multi-tabbed interface in DCE. It's where you manage your development "Cycles," write your prompts (Cycle Context), and, most importantly, paste and compare multiple different responses from your AI.

### **Q: What is a "Cycle"?**

**A:** A "Cycle" represents one iteration of the development loop: you write a prompt, get responses from the AI, select the best one, and integrate it into your codebase. The PCPP's Cycle Navigator allows you to move back and forth through your project's entire history, reviewing the exact context and AI responses from any previous cycle.

### **Q: What does the "Parse All" button do?**

**A:** After you paste raw responses from your AI into the response tabs, the "Parse All" button processes them. It automatically identifies the AI's summary, its plan, and any code blocks, transforming the raw text into a structured, easy-to-read view with syntax highlighting and file association.

### **Q: What are "Associated Files" and the `✓` / `✗` icons?**

**A:** When a response is parsed, DCE lists all the files the AI intended to create or modify under "Associated Files." It then checks your workspace to see if those files actually exist. A green checkmark (`✓`) means the file exists. A red 'x' (`✗`) means the file does not exist, which could indicate the AI is suggesting a new file or has "hallucinated" a file path.

### **Q: How does the native diff integration work?**

**A:** In the "Associated Files" list, you can click the "Open Changes" icon next to any existing file. This will open VS Code's built-in, side-by-side diff viewer, showing you a precise comparison between your current workspace file and the version suggested by the AI.

### **Q: What do the "Baseline (Commit)" and "Restore Baseline" buttons do?**

**A:** These buttons integrate DCE with Git. "Baseline" creates a Git commit of your current work, creating a safe restore point. After you "Accept" an AI's changes to test them, you can click "Restore Baseline" to instantly discard all those changes and revert your workspace to that safe point, allowing you to test another response without manual cleanup.

## III. Workflow & Usage

### **Q: How do I start a new project with DCE?**

**A:** Simply open a new, empty folder in VS Code. The DCE panel will automatically open to an "Onboarding" view. Describe your project's goal in the "Project Scope" text area and click "Generate Initial Artifacts Prompt." This will create a `prompt.md` file that you can use to ask an AI to generate the initial planning documents for your project.

### **Q: What is the recommended "perfect loop" workflow?**

**A:** The ideal workflow is a guided, iterative process:
1.  **Paste & Parse:** Get multiple AI responses and use "Parse All".
2.  **Select:** Review the parsed responses and click "Select This Response" on the best one.
3.  **Baseline:** Create a `git commit` restore point with the "Baseline" button.
4.  **Accept & Test:** In the "Associated Files" list, check the files you want to apply and click "Accept Selected". Then, test the changes in your application.
5.  **(If needed) Restore:** If the changes are bad, click "Restore Baseline" to revert everything instantly.
6.  **Finalize:** Once you're happy with the changes, write your notes for the next task in the "Cycle Context" and "Cycle Title" fields.
7.  **Generate & Repeat:** Click "Generate prompt.md" and then the `+` button to start the next cycle.

### **Q: Why should I use multiple responses?**

**A:** LLMs are non-deterministic. Asking for the same thing multiple times can yield vastly different solutions. The Parallel Co-Pilot Panel is designed to manage this, allowing you to generate 4, 8, or more responses at once and quickly compare them to find the most elegant, efficient, or creative solution.

### **Q: What is the difference between "Cycle Context" and "Ephemeral Context"?**

**A:**
*   **Cycle Context:** This is for your main instructions and goals for the current cycle. This content is saved and becomes part of the permanent history of your project.
*   **Ephemeral Context:** This is for temporary information that is only relevant for the *current* prompt generation, such as error logs or a snippet of code you want the AI to analyze. This content is **not** saved in the cycle history.

## IV. Local LLM & Demo Mode

### **Q: Can I use DCE with a local LLM?**

**A:** Yes. DCE supports connecting to any OpenAI-compatible API endpoint. You can run a model locally using a tool like vLLM or LM Studio, and then enter its URL (e.g., `http://localhost:8000/v1`) in the DCE settings panel to have the extension communicate directly with your local model.

### **Q: What is "Demo Mode"?**

**A:** "Demo Mode" is a pre-configured setting that connects the DCE extension to a specific, high-performance vLLM instance. When in this mode, the "Generate prompt.md" button is replaced with a "Generate responses" button, which fully automates the process of sending the prompt and streaming the responses back into the UI in real-time.

### **Q: What is the Response Progress UI?**

**A:** When using an automated connection mode like "Demo Mode," a special UI appears during generation. It shows real-time progress bars for each parallel response, token-per-second metrics, status indicators ("Thinking," "Generating," "Complete"), and timers. This gives you full visibility into the generation process.
