- **Key/Value for A0:**
- **Description:** A plan to automate the maintenance of the Master Artifact List (A0) by programmatically scanning artifact files for metadata tags.
- **Tags:** plan, automation, documentation, maintenance, a0

## 1. Vision & Goal

The Master Artifact List (`A0`) is the central index of the project's documentation. Currently, it is maintained manually, which is error-prone and tedious. The goal is to automate the generation and update of `A0` by scanning the `src/Artifacts` directory.

We will treat the individual artifact files as the "Source of Truth." Each artifact will contain a standardized metadata header. The system will read these headers and compile the `A0` list dynamically.

## 2. Metadata Schema

Every artifact file MUST start with a metadata block formatted as YAML-like comments or specific Markdown lines that are easily regex-parseable.

**Standard Header Format:**
```markdown
# Artifact A[ID]: [Title]
# Date Created: [Cycle]
# Author: [Author]
# Updated on: [Cycle] ([Change Log])

- **Key/Value for A0:**
- **Description:** [A concise description for A0]
- **Tags:** [comma, separated, tags]
```

## 3. Technical Implementation Plan

### 3.1. New Service: `ArtifactService`
We will create a new backend service, `ArtifactService`, responsible for managing documentation artifacts.

**Responsibilities:**
1.  **Scan:** Read all `.md` files in `src/Artifacts`.
2.  **Parse:** Extract ID, Title, Description, and Tags from the header of each file.
3.  **Generate:** Construct the `A0. DCE Master Artifact List.md` content.
4.  **Update:** Write the new `A0` content to disk.

### 3.2. State Awareness (Selection Sync)
The user expressed a desire for the `A0` list to be "state-aware" regarding selected files.
*   **Concept:** If a user deselects an artifact in the File Tree View (FTV), should it be removed from `A0`?
*   **Analysis:** `A0` serves as a global index. Removing items from `A0` just because they aren't currently selected for the *prompt* might degrade its utility as a map.
*   **Refined Approach:** `A0` should list *all* available artifacts. However, we can add a dynamic "Status" or "Included" indicator to the `A0` generation if it's being generated for a prompt context.

### 3.3. Automation Triggers
*   **On Command:** A command `dce.refreshMasterArtifactList` to manually trigger the rebuild.
*   **On Save:** A file watcher on `src/Artifacts/*.md` could trigger a rebuild (debounced) whenever a documentation file is modified.

## 4. Implementation Steps (Future Cycle)
1.  Create `ArtifactService.ts`.
2.  Implement regex parsers for the standard header.
3.  Implement the `generateA0` method.
4.  Register the command and watcher.
