## 1. Purpose

This document provides answers to common questions about the Data Curation Environment (DCE) VS Code extension. It is intended to be used as the primary knowledge base for the `aiascent.dev` website, helping new users understand the purpose, workflow, and features of the tool.

## Frequently Asked Questions

### General / What is DCE?

**Q: What is the Data Curation Environment (DCE)?**

**A:** The Data Curation Environment is a VS Code extension designed to streamline and enhance the workflow of AI-assisted software development. It provides a suite of tools to help developers manage the context they provide to Large Language Models (LLMs), compare multiple AI-generated responses, and safely test those responses in their local workspace.

**Q: Who is DCE for?**

**A:** DCE is for any developer, project manager, or "Citizen Architect" who uses AI to help them write code or documentation. It's especially useful for those who find themselves manually copying and pasting files into prompts, managing multiple AI conversations, and struggling to keep track of different AI suggestions.

**Q: Is DCE free?**

**A:** Yes, the DCE extension is free to use. It operates in a "manual mode" by default, where you generate a complete prompt file (`prompt.md`) and use it with your preferred AI model (like Google's AI Studio, ChatGPT, etc.) via copy and paste. This allows you to leverage the powerful context management and response comparison features without any API keys or costs.

**Q: Does DCE replace GitHub Copilot or other AI assistants?**

**A:** No, DCE is a collaborator with, not a replacement for, AI coding assistants. While tools like Copilot are excellent for inline code completion, DCE is designed for larger, more architectural tasks. It helps you manage the high-level conversation with an AI about multi-file changes, new features, or complex refactors.

### Core Workflow

**Q: What is the main workflow in DCE?**

**A:** The DCE workflow is organized into "Cycles" and follows a "Documentation First" principle. A typical cycle looks like this:
1.  **Curate Context:** Use the File Tree View (FTV) to check the files and folders you want the AI to know about.
2.  **Generate Prompt:** Write your instructions for the current cycle and click "Generate prompt.md". The DCE packages your instructions, the curated files, and the project history into a single prompt file.
3.  **Get Responses:** Copy the content of `prompt.md` and paste it into your favorite AI model's interface, generating multiple responses.
4.  **Compare & Test:** Paste the AI's responses back into the DCE's Parallel Co-Pilot Panel (PCPP). Here you can parse, compare, and diff the responses. Use the "Accept" and "Restore" features to safely test the AI's code in your workspace.
5.  **Start New Cycle:** Once you've accepted a solution, you write a summary for the next cycle and repeat the process.

**Q: What are "Artifacts"?**

**A:** Artifacts are formal project documents (like this FAQ!) stored in your project's `src/Artifacts` directory. They serve as the "source of truth" for your project's plans, requirements, and architecture. The DCE workflow encourages updating these documents before writing code.

### Key Features

**Q: What is the File Tree View (FTV) or "Context Chooser"?**

**A:** The FTV is a custom file explorer within VS Code. It has checkboxes next to every file and folder, allowing you to quickly select the exact context you want to include in your prompt. It also shows you token counts and other metadata to help you manage your context size.

**Q: What is the Parallel Co-Pilot Panel (PCPP)?**

**A:** The PCPP is the main hub for managing your interaction with the AI. It's a multi-tabbed panel where you can:
*   Write your instructions for each development "Cycle".
*   Paste and compare multiple AI responses side-by-side.
*   View diffs between the AI's suggestions and your current code.
*   Use Git-integrated "Baseline" and "Restore" buttons to safely test AI-generated code.
*   Navigate through your project's entire development history, cycle by cycle.

**Q: What does the "Baseline" and "Restore" functionality do?**

**A:** This is a powerful, Git-integrated testing feature.
*   **Baseline (Commit):** Before you test an AI's code, you can click "Baseline". This creates a Git commit of your current work, giving you a safe restore point.
*   **Restore Baseline:** If the AI's code doesn't work or you want to try a different response, clicking "Restore" will instantly discard all changes, reverting your files to the state of your last baseline. This allows for rapid, risk-free testing of multiple AI solutions.

### Local LLM / Demo Mode

**Q: Does DCE support local LLMs?**

**A:** Yes. In addition to the manual workflow, you can configure the DCE to connect to a local LLM that exposes an OpenAI-compatible API (like one running via vLLM or LM Studio). This enables a more automated workflow.

**Q: What is "Demo Mode"?**

**A:** "Demo Mode" is a pre-configured setting that connects the DCE to a local vLLM instance running on the `aiascent.game` server. When this mode is active, the "Generate prompt.md" button is replaced with a "Generate responses" button, which automates the entire process of sending the prompt and receiving responses.

**Q: Do I need a powerful GPU to use the local LLM features?**

**A:** To run a powerful local LLM yourself, you will generally need a modern NVIDIA GPU with a significant amount of VRAM (e.g., 12GB+). However, the "Demo Mode" is designed to connect to an existing server, so you can experience the automated workflow without needing to run the model on your own machine.

### Philosophy

**Q: What do you mean by "Process as Asset"?**

**A:** This is a core philosophy of the DCE. The tool is designed to capture the entire iterative development process—the context, the prompts, the multiple AI suggestions, and the developer's final decisions—as a persistent, structured history. This history (the "process") becomes a valuable asset for auditing, training, and future development.

**Q: What is a "Citizen Architect"?**

**A:** A "Citizen Architect" is an individual who can orchestrate AI to build complex, valuable systems. Their primary skill is not writing code line-by-line, but rather high-level orchestration, curation, and validation of AI's output. The DCE is a tool built to empower this new class of creator.
