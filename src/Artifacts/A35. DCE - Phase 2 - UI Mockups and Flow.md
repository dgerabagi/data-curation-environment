# Artifact A35: DCE - Phase 2 - UI Mockups and Flow
# Date Created: C69
# Author: AI Model
# Updated on: C158 (Add "Project Plan" button for navigation to Cycle 0)

## 1. Overview

This document describes the user interface (UI) and interaction flow for the Parallel Co-Pilot Panel. The design is centered around a two-stage workflow: **Input**, followed by a global **Parse** that transforms the entire panel into a **Review & Act** mode.

## 2. UI Mockup (Textual Description)

### 2.1. Main Header & Cycle Section
The main header contains global actions.

```
|-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| [ Project Plan ] [ Generate prompt.md ] [ Log State ] [ Parse All ] [ Sort by Tokens ] [ Resp: [ 4 ] ] |
|-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| [v] CYCLE & CONTEXT (C158: Review and Implement Feedback)                                       |
| |---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------| |
| | Cycle: [ < ] [ C158 ] [ > ] [ + ] [ Title Input... ] [Delete] [Reset]                       | |
| | [ Cycle Context Text Area... ]                                                              | |
| | [ Ephemeral Context Text Area... ]                                                          | |
|-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
```
*   **`[ Project Plan ]` (New):** A new button in the main header. Clicking it navigates the user back to the Cycle 0 "Onboarding View," allowing them to view and edit their master project scope.

### 2.2. Response Tabs
The tabs now display metadata when in parsed mode.

```
|=================================================================================================|
| [ Resp 1 (5 files, 2.1K tk) ] [ Resp 2 (4 files, 1.8K tk) ] [ Resp 3 ] [ Resp 4 ]                |
|-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
```
*   **Tab Metadata:** When parsed, each tab will show the number of files detected in its response and the total token count of those files.

### 2.3. Parsed View (Non-Diff Mode)
(No changes from C134)

### 2.4. Diff View
(No changes from C133)

## 3. User Interaction Flow

1.  **Edit Project Scope:** The user is on Cycle 158 and realizes they need to update their high-level project plan.
    *   They click the new **`[ Project Plan ]`** button.
    *   The PCPP view changes to the "Onboarding View" (Cycle 0), displaying the large text area with their current project scope.
    *   A "Return to Cycles" button is now visible.
    *   The user edits their project scope and the changes are auto-saved.
    *   They click "Return to Cycles" and are taken back to their latest cycle (Cycle 158). The next time they click "Generate prompt.md," the updated scope will be used.
2.  **Paste & Parse:** User pastes responses and clicks "Parse All". The tabs update to show metadata (e.g., "Resp 1 (5 files, 2.1K tk)").
3.  **Sort Responses:** The user notices "Resp 2" has a higher token count than "Resp 1". They click the **"Sort by Tokens"** button. The order of the tabs in the tab bar immediately changes to `[ Resp 2 ] [ Resp 1 ] [ Resp 4 ] [ Resp 3 ]` (based on their respective token counts). The user can now review the longest, likely most detailed, response first.
4.  **Select & Accept:** The rest of the workflow for selecting and accepting files remains the same.
