## 1. Overview & Goal

This document provides a clear, step-by-step roadmap for the implementation of Phase 2. The scope of Phase 2 is now defined as the **Parallel Co-Pilot Panel with state persistence and an integrated Diff Tool**. This roadmap breaks the large feature set into smaller, manageable, and testable steps. The goal is to build the functionality incrementally, ensuring a stable foundation at each stage.

## 2. Implementation Steps

### Step 1: Foundational UI & State Persistence (Highest Priority)

-   **Goal:** Create a functional UI for the PCPP where all user input is saved and restored reliably.
-   **Tasks:**
    1.  **Scaffolding & Config:** Ensure all files from `A42` are in place and correctly configured in `package.json`, `webpack.config.js`, etc.
    2.  **UI Development (`view.tsx`):**
        *   Build the static React components for the panel based on the updated mockup in `A35`.
        *   **Crucially, re-add the "Cycle Context" and "Ephemeral Context" text areas to fix the C87 regression.**
    3.  **Backend (`history.service.ts`):** Implement the core logic to read from and write to the `.vscode/dce_history.json` file.
    4.  **State Sync Loop:** Implement the full persistence loop. Changes in the frontend UI trigger a debounced `SaveCycleData` IPC message. The backend `HistoryService` updates the JSON file.
-   **Outcome:** A visible panel where any text typed into any field is saved and restored when the panel is closed and reopened or moved to a new window.

### Step 2: Cycle Navigator

-   **Goal:** Enable navigation through the persistent history created in Step 1.
-   **Tasks:**
    1.  **IPC:** Implement the `RequestCycleHistoryList` and `RequestCycleData` channels.
    2.  **Frontend (`view.tsx`):**
        *   On load, fetch the list of all cycle IDs to determine the valid range for navigation (`1` to `maxCycleId`).
        *   Wire the `<` and `>` buttons to change the `currentCycleId` state.
        *   Create a `useEffect` hook that listens for changes to `currentCycleId` and requests the corresponding data from the backend.
        *   The handler for `SendCycleData` will update the entire panel's state with the historical data.
-   **Outcome:** The user can click the back and forward buttons to load and view the complete state of the PCPP from previous cycles.

### Step 3: File Association and Diffing

-   **Goal:** Implement the ability to see a diff for any file mentioned in an AI response.
-   **Tasks:**
    1.  **Add Dependency:** Add the `diff` library to `package.json`.
    2.  **UI (`view.tsx`):**
        *   Implement the "Associated Files" list UI element. It will be populated by the `detectedFiles` state, which is already being parsed.
        *   Make each file in the list a clickable button.
    3.  **IPC:** Create a `RequestFileContent` channel.
    4.  **Backend (`fs.service.ts`):** Implement a handler that reads a file's content and sends it back.
    5.  **Component (`DiffViewer.tsx`):** Create a new component that takes two strings and renders a side-by-side or inline diff.
    6.  **Workflow:** Clicking a file in the list sends `RequestFileContent`. When the content arrives, the frontend shows the `DiffViewer` component (e.g., in a modal) with the original content and the content from the AI response.
-   **Outcome:** The user can paste a response and immediately get a clear, color-coded view of the changes being proposed for any file.

### Step 4: Core "Swap" Functionality

-   **Goal:** Implement the "Swap with Source" feature.
-   **Tasks:**
    1.  **IPC Channels:** Implement `RequestSwapFileContent`.
    2.  **Backend (`fs.service.ts`):** Implement the `handleSwapFileContentRequest` method.
    3.  **Frontend (`view.tsx`):** Wire up the "Swap" button to trigger the IPC message.
-   **Outcome:** The user can test AI-generated code in their workspace with a single click.

### Step 5: Advanced Features (Future Cycles)

-   **Goal:** Implement remaining features from the vision.
-   **Tasks:**
    *   Annotation and Rating (Comments, Thumbs Up/Down).
    *   Live API Integration (The new Phase 3).
    *   Advanced UI from `A50` (Resizable panes, inner editors).
