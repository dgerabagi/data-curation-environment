# Artifact A65: DCE - Universal Task Checklist
# Date Created: C165
# Author: AI Model & Curator

- **Key/Value for A0:**
- **Description:** A universal checklist for organizing development tasks by file, focusing on complexity in terms of token count and estimated cycles for completion.
- **Tags:** process, checklist, task management, planning, workflow

## 1. Purpose

This artifact serves as a dynamic checklist to track and organize development tasks. It groups tasks by the primary file(s) they affect, which provides a clear view of the workload for each part of the codebase. "Complexity" is estimated in terms of the total token count of the involved files and the anticipated number of development cycles required to complete the task.

## 2. Cycle 165 Task List

### I. Core Logic & Services (`src/backend/services/`)

| File(s) | Task | Complexity (Tokens / Cycles) | Status | Notes |
| :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- |
| `prompt.service.ts` | **Fix Master Artifact List population:** Use the user's `A0` file, not the extension's. | Low (~4k / 1) | **In Progress** | Requires a `findFiles` call to locate the user's artifact. |
| `prompt.service.ts` | **Preserve Cycle 0 Templates:** Always include `T*` artifacts in every `prompt.md`. | Medium (~4k / 1) | **In Progress** | Change prompt generation to always read and inject templates. |
| `prompt.service.ts` | **Filter future cycles from prompt:** Don't include cycles beyond the current one when generating from history. | Low (~4k / 1) | **In Progress** | Add a filter to the history array before generating the `<M6>` block. |
| `history.service.ts` | **Handle "No Folder Opened":** Detect when no workspace is open and signal the PCPP. | Low (~2.5k / 1) | **In Progress** | Check `vscode.workspace.workspaceFolders` and return a special state. |
| `file-tree.service.ts` | **Make `package-lock.json` un-selectable:** Add to `NON_SELECTABLE_PATTERNS`. | Very Low (~3.4k / 1) | **In Progress** | Simple configuration change. |
| `file-operation.service.ts` | **Fix multi-file delete:** Ensure all selected files are deleted, not just one. | Medium (~4k / 1) | **In Progress** | The bug is likely on the frontend, in how the list of files to delete is passed. The backend service should be correct. |

### II. Frontend Components (`src/client/components/`)

| File(s) | Task | Complexity (Tokens / Cycles) | Status | Notes |
| :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- |
| `tree-view/TreeView.tsx` | **Fix multi-file delete trigger:** Ensure the `Delete` key handler uses the multi-select state. | Medium (~4.5k / 1) | **In Progress** | The `handleKeyDown` function needs to check `selectedPaths` before `focusedNodePath`. |

### III. Frontend Views (`src/client/views/`)

| File(s) | Task | Complexity (Tokens / Cycles) | Status | Notes |
| :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- |
| `parallel-copilot.view/view.tsx` | **Handle "No Folder Opened" state:** Conditionally render a message and "Open Folder" button. | Low (~8k / 1) | **In Progress** | Add a new UI state based on the flag from `history.service.ts`. |

### IV. Documentation (`src/Artifacts/`)

| File(s) | Task | Complexity (Tokens / Cycles) | Status | Notes |
| :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- |
| `A0`, `A65`, `T17` | Create and update checklist artifacts. | N/A | **Complete** | This task. |
