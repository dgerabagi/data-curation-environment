# Artifact A65: DCE - Universal Task Checklist
# Date Created: C165
# Author: AI Model & Curator
# Updated on: C22 (Add new tasks from playtest feedback)

## 1. Purpose

This artifact provides a structured, universal format for tracking development tasks, feedback, and bugs. Unlike cycle-specific trackers, this checklist organizes work by the group of files involved in a given task. It also introduces a simple complexity metric based on the total token count of the affected files and an estimation of whether the task will require more than one development cycle to complete.

This file-centric approach helps in planning and prioritizing work, especially in an AI-assisted development workflow where context size (token count) is a primary constraint.

## 2. How to Use

-   **Group by File Packages:** Create a new `##` section for each logical task or feature. List all the files that are expected to be modified for this task.
-   **Assign an ID:** Give each task package a unique, simple ID (e.g., `T-1`, `T-2`) for easy reference in feedback.
-   **Estimate Complexity:**
    -   Calculate the **Total Tokens** for all files in the package. This gives a quantitative measure of the context size.
    -   Estimate if the task is likely to take **More than one cycle?**. This is a qualitative judgment based on the complexity of the changes required.
-   **List Action Items:** Under each file package, create a checklist of specific actions, bugs to fix, or features to implement.
-   **Add Verification Steps:** After the action items, add a section describing how the curator should test the feature to confirm it is working as expected.
-   **Note on Output Length:** Remember that the maximum output length for a single response is approximately 65,000 tokens. Do not prematurely stop generating files; attempt to complete as many full files as possible within this limit.
-   **Keep it Current:** At the beginning of each new cycle, review and update this checklist. Move completed tasks to a "Completed" section, add new tasks based on feedback, and re-prioritize as needed. This ensures the checklist remains a living, accurate reflection of the project's status.

## Task List for Cycle 22+

## T-1: Fix Onboarding Auto-Save Icon
- **Files Involved:**
    - `src/client/views/parallel-copilot.view/view.tsx`
- **Total Tokens:** ~8,500
- **More than one cycle?** No
- **Status:** In Progress

- [ ] **Task (T-ID: 1.1):** The `useEffect` hook listening for `NotifySaveComplete` is missing a dependency on `saveStatus`. Add it to the dependency array to ensure the callback has the latest state and can correctly transition from 'saving' to 'saved'.

### Verification Steps
1.  Launch the extension in a fresh workspace to trigger the onboarding view.
2.  Type a character in the "Project Scope" text area.
3.  **Expected:** The save status icon should change from a checkmark to a caution sign.
4.  Stop typing.
5.  **Expected:** The icon should change to a circular processing animation, and then, after a short delay, it should change back to the green checkmark. It should not get stuck on the processing animation.

## T-2: Fix File Duplication Bug
- **Files Involved:**
    - `src/backend/services/flattener.service.ts`
    - `src/backend/services/file-tree.service.ts`
- **Total Tokens:** ~6,800
- **More than one cycle?** No
- **Status:** In Progress

- [ ] **Task (T-ID: 2.1):** Add a safeguard in `flattener.service.ts` to de-duplicate the incoming file path list using `[...new Set(paths)]` before any processing occurs.
- [ ] **Task (T-ID: 2.2):** Review and harden the `processAutoAddQueue` logic in `file-tree.service.ts` to prevent race conditions that might add duplicate files to the selection state.

### Verification Steps
1.  Enable "Automatically add new files to selection".
2.  Create a new workspace and go through the Cycle 0 onboarding to generate the initial set of artifacts.
3.  Click "Flatten Context".
4.  Inspect the generated `flattened_repo.md` file.
5.  **Expected:** The file list and content should contain no duplicate file paths.

## T-3: Implement "Open All" Button
- **Files Involved:**
    - `src/client/views/parallel-copilot.view/components/ParsedView.tsx`
    - `src/backend/services/file-operation.service.ts`
    - `src/common/ipc/channels.enum.ts`
    - `src/common/ipc/channels.type.ts`
    - `src/client/views/parallel-copilot.view/on-message.ts`
- **Total Tokens:** ~8,000
- **More than one cycle?** No
- **Status:** In Progress

- [ ] **Task (T-ID: 3.1):** Add an "Open All" button to the header of the "Associated Files" section in `ParsedView.tsx`.
- [ ] **Task (T-ID: 3.2):** Create a new `RequestBatchFileOpen` IPC channel.
- [ ] **Task (T-ID: 3.3):** Implement the `handleBatchFileOpenRequest` method in `file-operation.service.ts` to iterate through a list of paths and open each one.

### Verification Steps
1.  Parse a response with multiple associated files.
2.  Click the "Open All" button.
3.  **Expected:** All files listed in the "Associated Files" section should open as new tabs in the VS Code editor.

## T-4: Plan Native Diff Integration
- **Files Involved:**
    - `src/Artifacts/A88. DCE - Native Diff Integration Plan.md`
- **Total Tokens:** ~1,000
- **More than one cycle?** Yes (Implementation is deferred)
- **Status:** In Progress

- [ ] **Task (T-ID: 4.1):** Create the new planning artifact `A88` to detail the implementation of a native VS Code diff view using a `TextDocumentContentProvider`.

### Verification Steps
1.  Check the `src/Artifacts` directory.
2.  **Expected:** The new `A88` artifact should exist and contain a detailed technical plan.
