# Artifact T13: Template - Refactoring Plan
# Date Created: C152
# Author: AI Model & Curator

- **Key/Value for A0:**
- **Description:** A generic template for a refactoring plan, guiding users to consider constraints like token count.
- **Tags:** template, cycle 0, documentation, project setup, refactor

## 1. Problem Statement

The file `[path/to/problematic/file.ts]` has become difficult to maintain due to [e.g., its large size, high complexity, mixing of multiple responsibilities]. This is leading to [e.g., slower development, increased bugs, high token count for LLM context].

## 2. Refactoring Goals

1.  **Improve Readability:** Make the code easier to understand and follow.
2.  **Reduce Complexity:** Break down large functions and classes into smaller, more focused units.
3.  **Increase Maintainability:** Make it easier to add new features or fix bugs in the future.
4.  **Constraint:** The primary constraint for this refactor is to **reduce the token count** of the file(s) to make them more manageable for AI-assisted development.

## 3. Proposed Refactoring Plan

The monolithic file/class will be broken down into the following smaller, more focused modules/services:

### 3.1. New Service/Module A: `[e.g., DataProcessingService.ts]`

-   **Responsibility:** This service will be responsible for all logic related to [e.g., processing raw data].
-   **Functions/Methods to move here:**
    -   `functionA()`
    -   `functionB()`

### 3.2. New Service/Module B: `[e.g., ApiClientService.ts]`

-   **Responsibility:** This service will encapsulate all external API communication.
-   **Functions/Methods to move here:**
    -   `fetchDataFromApi()`
    -   `postDataToApi()`

### 3.3. Original File (`[e.g., MainController.ts]`):

-   **Responsibility:** The original file will be simplified to act as a coordinator, orchestrating calls to the new services.
-   **Changes:**
    -   Remove the moved functions.
    -   Import and instantiate the new services.
    -   Update the main logic to delegate work to the appropriate service.

## 4. Benefits

-   **Reduced Token Count:** The original file's token count will be significantly reduced.
-   **Improved Maintainability:** Each new service has a single, clear responsibility.
-   **Easier Testing:** The smaller, focused services will be easier to unit test in isolation.
