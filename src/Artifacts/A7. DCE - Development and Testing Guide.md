- **Description:** A step-by-step guide explaining how to run, debug, and test the DCE extension within VS Code using the Extension Development Host.
- **Tags:** development, testing, debugging, workflow, vs code extension, f5, launch.json

## 1. Purpose

This guide provides the correct and simplified procedure for running and testing the Data Curation Environment (DCE) extension locally. Following these steps is crucial to see your changes and the extension's UI in action.

## 2. The Core Concept: The Extension Development Host

You cannot see the extension's UI (like the spiral icon or the custom panel) in the same VS Code window where you are writing the code. Instead, you must launch a special, separate VS Code window called the **Extension Development Host**. This new window has your extension installed and running, allowing you to test it as a user would.

Our project now includes the necessary `.vscode/launch.json` and `.vscode/tasks.json` files to make this process seamless.

## 3. Step-by-Step Workflow

Follow these steps every time you want to test the extension:

### Step 1: Open the "Run and Debug" View

In your main project window (e.g., `C:\Projects\DCE`), navigate to the "Run and Debug" panel in the activity bar on the left. The icon looks like a play button with a bug on it.

### Step 2: Launch the Extension

At the top of the "Run and Debug" panel, you will see a dropdown menu. It should already have **"Run Extension"** selected.

Simply press the **F5** key or click the green play button next to the "Run Extension" dropdown.

This single action will now:
1.  Automatically start the `npm run watch` task in the background to compile your code.
2.  Launch the new **"[Extension Development Host]"** VS Code window.

### Step 3: Find the Extension UI

In the newly opened **Extension Development Host** window, look at the activity bar on the far left. You should now see our spiral icon. Clicking this icon will open the "Context Chooser" panel, where you'll see the file tree with checkboxes.

### Step 4: Making and Viewing Changes

1.  **Make Code Changes:** Edit the source code in your **original** project window.
2.  **Auto-Compile:** When you save a file, the `npm run watch` task (which was started automatically) will recompile it. You can see its progress in the terminal panel of your original window.
3.  **Reload the Host:** To see your changes, go to the **Extension Development Host** window (the one you launched with F5) and reload it. The easiest way is to open the Command Palette (`Ctrl+Shift+P` or `Cmd+Shift+P`) and run the command **`Developer: Reload Window`**.

You only need to stop the debugger (Shift+F5) and restart it (F5) if you make changes to configuration files like `package.json`. For all other code changes, simply reloading the host window is sufficient and much faster.
