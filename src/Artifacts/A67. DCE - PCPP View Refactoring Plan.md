# Artifact A67. DCE - PCPP View Refactoring Plan

- **Key/Value for A0:**
- **Description:** A plan to refactor the large `parallel-copilot.view.tsx` into smaller, more manageable components to improve maintainability.
- **Tags:** refactor, architecture, technical debt, pcpp

## 1. Problem Statement

The `parallel-copilot.view/view.tsx` component has become a "god component," currently exceeding 8,000 tokens. It manages the state and rendering for the entire Parallel Co-Pilot Panel, including:
-   The main view and the onboarding view.
-   The cycle navigator.
-   The context input text areas.
-   The response tab bar.
-   The raw text view for each tab.
-   The complex, multi-pane parsed view.
-   The diff viewer.
-   All associated state management (`useState`, `useMemo`, `useEffect`).
-   All IPC message handling.

This monolithic structure makes the component difficult to read, debug, and maintain. A single change can have unintended consequences, and the high token count makes it a challenging file to work with.

## 2. Refactoring Plan

The goal is to break down `view.tsx` into a series of smaller, single-responsibility components. The main `view.tsx` file will be refactored into a "container" component that manages the core state and orchestrates the new, smaller "presentational" components.

### 2.1. Proposed Component Structure

-   **`view.tsx` (Container):**
    -   **Responsibility:** Manages all primary state (`currentCycle`, `tabs`, `isParsedMode`, etc.) and all IPC message handlers. It will render the appropriate child components and pass down state and callbacks as props.

-   **`src/client/views/parallel-copilot.view/components/` (New Directory):**
    -   **`CycleNavigator.tsx`:** Renders the cycle navigation bar, including the cycle number, title input, and navigation buttons. Receives the current cycle state and `onCycleChange` callbacks as props.
    -   **`ContextInputs.tsx`:** Renders the "Cycle Context" and "Ephemeral Context" text areas, including their new line number and token count displays. Receives content and `onChange` handlers as props.
    -   **`ResponseTabs.tsx`:** Renders the main tab bar. Receives the list of tabs, the active tab, and the `onTabSelect` handler as props.
    -   **`ResponsePane.tsx`:** A larger component responsible for rendering the content of a single, active tab. It will contain the logic to display either the raw `textarea` or the parsed view.
    -   **`ParsedView.tsx`:** Renders the multi-pane parsed view, including the "Associated Files" list, summary, and course of action. It will contain the logic for selecting a file to view.
    -   **`CodeViewer.tsx`:** Renders the syntax-highlighted code or the `DiffViewer`. Receives the file content and diff data as props.
    -   **`NumberedTextarea.tsx`:** The new reusable component for text areas with line numbers and resizing.

## 3. Benefits of Refactoring

-   **Improved Readability:** Each component will be smaller and focused on a single part of the UI, making the code easier to understand.
-   **Improved Maintainability:** Bugs and feature requests can be addressed in isolated components, reducing the risk of unintended side effects.
-   **Reduced Token Count:** Splitting the large file into many smaller ones makes each file more manageable for both human and AI developers.
-   **Better Performance:** Memoization (`React.memo`) can be applied more effectively to smaller components, preventing unnecessary re-renders.
