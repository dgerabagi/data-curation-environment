- **Key/Value for A0:**
- **Description:** Details the user stories and technical implementation for the "Regenerate" button in the PCPP, including logic for regenerating empty tabs, all tabs, and a new per-tab refresh feature with double-click confirmation.

## 1. Vision & Goal

The workflow for generating AI responses needs to be more flexible and deliberate. Users may decide they need more responses after the initial batch, a single response might be of low quality, or they may accidentally click the regenerate button. The goal of this feature is to provide intuitive, granular controls for regenerating responses while preventing accidental actions.

## 2. User Stories & Button Behaviors

| ID | User Story | Acceptance Criteria |
|---|---|---|
| P2-REG-01 | **Regenerate Empty Tabs** | As a user, after increasing the number of response tabs from 4 to 6, I want to click the global "Regenerate responses" button, which should only generate new responses for the two new, empty tabs. | - A global "Regenerate responses" button exists in the PCPP header. <br> - If one or more response tabs are empty, clicking this button triggers a batch generation request only for the number of empty tabs. <br> - The new responses populate only the empty tabs. |
| P2-REG-02 | **Regenerate All Tabs** | As a user, if all my response tabs have content but I'm unsatisfied, I want to click the global "Regenerate responses" button and be asked if I want to regenerate *all* responses. | - If no response tabs are empty, clicking "Regenerate responses" shows a confirmation dialog. <br> - If confirmed, a batch request is sent to generate a full new set of responses, which replaces the content in all existing tabs. |
| P2-REG-03 | **Regenerate a Single Tab (from Tab View)** | As a user, if one specific response is poor, I want a "Refresh" icon on that tab to regenerate just that single response without affecting others. | - A "Refresh" icon appears on each response tab. <br> - Clicking this icon triggers a generation request for a single response. <br> - The new response replaces the content of only that specific tab. <br> - The main content area for the active tab switches to show the `GenerationProgressDisplay` to show the new response streaming in. |
| P2-REG-04 | **Re-generate a Single Response (from Progress View)** | As a user watching responses stream in, if one response seems stuck or is generating poorly, I want a "Re-generate" button next to it to discard the current attempt and start a new one for just that slot. | - In the `GenerationProgressDisplay`, a "Re-generate" button is available for each response. <br> - Clicking it stops the current generation for that response (if active) and immediately initiates a new request for that single response slot. |
| P2-REG-05 | **Prevent Accidental Regeneration** | As a user, I want to confirm my intent to regenerate a response, so I don't accidentally lose a good response by misclicking. | - The first click on a "Regenerate" button (on a tab) changes its icon to a "Confirm" (checkmark) icon. <br> - A second click on the same button within a few seconds triggers the regeneration. <br> - If the user does not click again, the button reverts to its original state. |

## 3. Technical Implementation Plan (C78 Update)

1.  **IPC Channels:** Existing channels are sufficient.

2.  **Frontend UI & Logic:**
    *   **Double-Click Confirmation (`ResponseTabs.tsx`):**
        *   Introduce a new local state `const [regenConfirmTabId, setRegenConfirmTabId] = useState<number | null>(null);`.
        *   The `onClick` handler for the regenerate button will implement the two-click logic. The first click sets the state, the second click triggers the regeneration and resets the state.
        *   A `useEffect` hook with a `setTimeout` will be used to reset the confirmation state after 3-4 seconds if no second click occurs.
        *   The button icon will be conditionally rendered (`VscSync` or `VscCheck`) based on the `regenConfirmTabId` state.
    *   **Per-Tab Progress View (`view.tsx`):**
        *   The `handleRegenerateTab` function will update the `status` of the specific response in the `tabs` state to `'generating'`.
        *   The main render logic will be refactored. It will check the status of the `activeTab`. If `tabs[activeTab].status === 'generating'`, it will render the `GenerationProgressDisplay` component. Otherwise, it will render the `ResponsePane`.

3.  **Backend Logic (Per-Response Status):**
    *   **`pcpp.types.ts`:** Add `status: 'pending' | 'generating' | 'complete' | 'error'` to the `PcppResponse` interface.
    *   **`history.service.ts`:**
        *   The `updateSingleResponseInCycle` method will be updated to set the `status` of the target response to `'generating'` and reset its content.
        *   When the response is fully received (from `llm.service.ts`), this method will be called again to set the status to `'complete'` and update the content.
    *   **`llm.service.ts`:**
        *   The `stopGeneration` method will be implemented using a `Map<number, AbortController>` to track and abort `fetch` requests.
