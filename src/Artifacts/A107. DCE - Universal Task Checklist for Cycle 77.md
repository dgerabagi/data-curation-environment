# Date Created: C77

## 1. Purpose

This artifact provides a structured checklist for tracking the development tasks, feedback, and bugs identified in Cycle 77. It organizes the work by logical feature area and the group of files involved in each task to help plan and prioritize development.

## Task List for Cycle 77+

## T-1: Fix Stale Prompt Generation
- **Files Involved:**
    - `src/backend/services/prompt.service.ts`
    - `src/client/views/parallel-copilot.view/on-message.ts`
- **Total Tokens:** ~7,150
- **More than one cycle?** No
- **Status:** To Do

- [ ] **Task (T-ID: 1.1):** Correct the logic in `prompt.service.ts` (`_generateCyclesContent`) to ensure the fresh `cycleData` from the client overwrites the stale data from the history file for the current cycle.
- [ ] **Task (T-ID: 1.2):** Add detailed logging in the `on-message.ts` handler for `RequestNewCycleAndGenerate` to dump the received `cycleData` object for easier debugging.

### Verification Steps
1.  In Demo Mode, start a new project and generate initial responses.
2.  In Cycle 1, add significant text to the "Cycle Context" text area.
3.  Click `Generate responses`.
4.  Check the `dce.log` output.
5.  **Expected:** The log should show the `cycleData` object with the correct, non-empty `cycleContext`.
6.  Open the newly generated `prompt.md` file.
7.  **Expected:** The `<Cycle 1>` block within `<M6. Cycles>` should contain the text you entered in the "Cycle Context" area.

## T-2: Fix Delayed Response Parsing
- **Files Involved:**
    - `src/client/views/parallel-copilot.view/view.tsx`
- **Total Tokens:** ~9,400
- **More than one cycle?** No
- **Status:** To Do

- [ ] **Task (T-ID: 2.1):** Modify the `UpdateGenerationProgress` message handler in `view.tsx`.
- [ ] **Task (T-ID: 2.2):** When a response's status in the progress update changes to `'complete'`, immediately call `parseResponse` on that tab's content.
- [ ] **Task (T-ID: 2.3):** Update the `tabs` state for that specific tab with the new `parsedContent`.

### Verification Steps
1.  In Demo Mode, start a generation of 4 responses.
2.  Observe the response tabs in the main PCPP view.
3.  **Expected:** As each response finishes generating, its tab should switch from the loading spinner to the parsed view individually, without showing a "PARSING FAILED" message and without waiting for all other responses to complete.
