## 1. General Concepts

### Q: What is the Data Curation Environment (DCE)?
**A:** The Data Curation Environment is a VS Code extension designed to streamline AI-assisted development. It helps you manage the files and context you provide to Large Language Models (LLMs), compare multiple AI-generated responses side-by-side, and integrate the AI's suggestions back into your codebase in a structured and efficient way.

### Q: What problem does DCE solve?
**A:** DCE solves the problem of "context management." When working with AI on a large project, it's difficult to manually copy and paste all the relevant code into a prompt. DCE provides a user interface to select files and folders, "flatten" them into a single context file (`prompt.md`), and manage the entire iterative workflow of prompting, reviewing, and testing AI-generated code.

### Q: Who is DCE for?
**A:** DCE is for any developer, researcher, or creator who uses Large Language Models as part of their workflow. It's particularly useful for those working on complex, multi-file projects who want a more structured and efficient way to collaborate with an AI.

### Q: What is the "artifact-driven workflow"?
**A:** This is the core philosophy of DCE. It means that before writing code, you first write a planning document (an "artifact") that describes the goals, requirements, or design. This "documentation-first" approach ensures that both you and the AI are aligned on the objective, leading to better, more consistent results.

## 2. Getting Started

### Q: How do I install the DCE extension?
**A:** You can install the DCE extension from the Visual Studio Code Marketplace. Search for "Data Curation Environment" and click "Install."

### Q: I've installed the extension. What's the first thing I should do?
**A:** When you open a new, empty folder, the DCE's "Parallel Co-Pilot Panel" will open to an onboarding screen. The first step is to describe your project's high-level goals in the "Project Scope" text area. From there, the extension will guide you to generate your initial set of planning documents.

### Q: What is `prompt.md`?
**A:** The `prompt.md` file is the final, assembled prompt that you copy and paste into your AI model's chat interface. The DCE automatically generates this file for you by combining your project artifacts, cycle history, and the flattened code from your selected files.

### Q: Do I need to use Git?
**A:** While not strictly required, using Git is highly recommended. DCE has integrated features like "Baseline (Commit)" and "Restore Baseline" that leverage Git to allow you to safely test AI-generated code and instantly revert any changes if they don't work.

## 3. Core Features

### Q: What is the "Context Chooser" (File Tree View)?
**A:** This is the panel with the spiral icon. It shows your entire project's file tree with checkboxes next to each file and folder. You use these checkboxes to select which files you want to include in your flattened context for the AI.

### Q: What is the "Parallel Co-Pilot Panel" (PCPP)?
**A:** This is the main interface for managing the AI workflow. It's a multi-tabbed panel where you can paste different AI responses, parse them into a structured view, compare them, and accept their changes into your codebase.

### Q: What are "Cycles"?
**A:** A "Cycle" represents one round of the iterative development process: you write a prompt, get AI responses, and select one to integrate. The PCPP has a "Cycle Navigator" that lets you move back and forth through your project's history to see the context and AI suggestions from previous cycles.

### Q: What does "Parse All" do?
**A:** When you paste raw responses from your AI into the PCPP tabs, they are just plain text. Clicking "Parse All" tells the extension to read the text in all tabs and process it into a structured view, separating the AI's summary, its course of action, and the individual code files it generated. This makes the response much easier to review.

### Q: What does "Accept Selected Files" do?
**A:** After you parse a response, you'll see a list of "Associated Files" that the AI generated. You can check the boxes next to the files you like and then click "Accept Selected Files" to have the DCE write those files directly into your workspace.

## 4. Workflow Questions

### Q: What is the difference between "Manual Mode" and "Demo Mode"?
**A:**
*   **Manual Mode** is the default. It's a "bring your own AI" model where you generate a `prompt.md` file, copy it to your preferred AI (like Gemini, Claude, etc.), and then paste the AI's response back into the DCE.
*   **Demo Mode** is an automated workflow that connects the DCE directly to a locally running LLM. In this mode, a "Generate responses" button sends the prompt directly to the model and streams the responses back into the PCPP automatically.

### Q: How do I choose between multiple AI responses?
**A:** The PCPP is designed for this. After parsing, you can quickly switch between tabs to see each AI's plan and code. The UI shows you metadata like how many files were changed and the total token count. Once you find the best response, you click "Select This Response" to mark it as the chosen solution for that cycle.

### Q: Can I regenerate just one bad response?
**A:** Yes. Each response tab has a "Regenerate" (refresh icon) button. This allows you to re-run the prompt for just that one slot without affecting the other responses you received.

## 5. Advanced Topics & Troubleshooting

### Q: Why do some files in the file tree have a grayed-out checkbox?
**A:** The DCE automatically excludes certain files and folders that are generally not useful for an AI's context. This includes directories like `.git`, `node_modules`, `dist`, and build artifacts like `package-lock.json`. This helps keep your context clean and focused.

### Q: My AI's response won't parse correctly. What can I do?
**A:** Parsing failures usually happen when the AI doesn't follow the required output format (e.g., it forgets a closing `
