# Artifact T15: Template - A-B-C Testing Strategy for UI Bugs
# Date Created: C154
# Author: AI Model & Curator

- **Key/Value for A0:**
- **Description:** A generic template for a guide on using the A-B-C testing pattern to diagnose UI bugs.
- **Tags:** template, cycle 0, process, debugging, troubleshooting

## 1. Overview & Goal

When a user interface (UI) bug, particularly related to event handling (`onClick`, `onDrop`, etc.), proves resistant to conventional debugging, it often indicates a complex root cause. Continuously attempting small fixes on the main, complex component can be inefficient.

The goal of the **A-B-C Testing Strategy** is to break this cycle by creating a test harness with multiple, simplified, independent test components. Each test component attempts to solve the same basic problem using a slightly different technical approach, allowing for rapid diagnosis.

## 2. The Strategy

### 2.1. Core Principles
1.  **Preserve the Original:** Never remove existing functionality to build a test case. The original component should remain as the "control" in the experiment.
2.  **Isolate Variables:** Each test case should be as simple as possible, designed to test a single variable (e.g., raw event handling vs. local state updates).
3.  **Run in Parallel:** The original component and all test components should be accessible from the same UI (e.g., via tabs) for immediate comparison.

### 2.2. Steps
1.  **Identify the Core Problem:** Isolate the most fundamental action that is failing (e.g., "A click on a list item is not being registered").
2.  **Create Test Harness:** Refactor the main view to act as a "test harness" that can switch between the original component and several new test components.
3.  **Implement Isolated Test Components:** Create new, simple components for each test case.
    *   **Test A (Barebones):** The simplest possible implementation. Use raw HTML elements with inline event handlers that only log to the console.
    *   **Test B (Local State):** Introduce state management to test the component's ability to re-render on an event.
    *   **Test C (Prop-Driven):** Use a child component that calls a function passed down via props, testing the prop-drilling pattern.
4.  **Analyze Results:** Interact with each tab to see which implementation succeeds, thereby isolating the architectural pattern that is failing.

## 3. Cleanup Process

Once a working pattern is identified in a test component:
1.  **Codify Findings:** Document the successful pattern and the root cause of the failure.
2.  **Integrate Solution:** Refactor the original component to use the successful pattern.
3.  **Remove Test Artifacts:** Delete the test harness UI and the temporary test component files.
