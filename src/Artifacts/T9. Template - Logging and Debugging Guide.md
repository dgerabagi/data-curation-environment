# Artifact T9: Template - Logging and Debugging Guide
# Date Created: C141
# Author: AI Model & Curator

- **Key/Value for A0:**
- **Description:** A generic template for a logging and debugging guide.
- **Tags:** template, cycle 0, documentation, project setup

## 1. Purpose

This document provides instructions on how to access and use the logging features built into the project. Effective logging is crucial for diagnosing performance issues, tracking down bugs, and understanding the application's behavior during development.

## 2. Log Locations

### Location 1: The Browser Developer Console

This is where you find logs from the **frontend**.

-   **What you'll see here:** `console.log()` statements from React components and client-side scripts.
-   **Where to find it:** Open your browser, right-click anywhere on the page, select "Inspect", and navigate to the "Console" tab.

### Location 2: The Server Terminal

This is where you find logs from the **backend** (the Node.js process).

-   **What you'll see here:** `console.log()` statements from your server-side code, API handlers, and services.
-   **Where to find it:** The terminal window where you started the server (e.g., via `npm start`).

## 3. Tactical Debugging with Logs

When a feature is not working as expected, the most effective debugging technique is to add **tactical logs** at every step of the data's journey to pinpoint where the process is failing.

### Example Data Flow for Debugging:

1.  **Frontend Component (`MyComponent.tsx`):** Log the user's input right before sending it.
    `console.log('[Component] User clicked save. Sending data:', dataToSend);`
2.  **Frontend Service (`api.service.ts`):** Log the data just before it's sent over the network.
    `console.log('[API Service] Making POST request to /api/data with body:', body);`
3.  **Backend Route (`server.ts`):** Log the data as soon as it's received by the server.
    `console.log('[API Route] Received POST request on /api/data with body:', req.body);`
4.  **Backend Service (`database.service.ts`):** Log the data just before it's written to the database.
    `console.log('[DB Service] Attempting to write to database:', data);`

By following the logs through this chain, you can identify exactly where the data becomes corrupted, is dropped, or causes an error.
