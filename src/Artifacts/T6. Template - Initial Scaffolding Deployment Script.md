## 1. Overview

This artifact contains a template for a Node.js script (`deploy_scaffold.js`). Its original purpose was to automate the creation of the initial project structure for a new project.

**This artifact is now DEPRECATED.** The modern workflow of the Data Curation Environment involves the AI generating file artifacts (`<file path="...">`) directly in its responses. Users can then accept these files into their workspace with a single click. This direct-generation model makes a separate, standalone scaffolding script redundant and obsolete. This template is kept for historical reference only.
