- **Key/Value for A0:**
- **Description:** Outlines a development pattern for creating parallel, isolated test components to diagnose and resolve persistent UI bugs, such as event handling or rendering issues.
- **Tags:** process, debugging, troubleshooting, ui, ux, react

## 1. Overview & Goal

When a user interface (UI) bug, particularly related to event handling (`onClick`, `onDrop`, etc.) or component rendering, proves resistant to conventional debugging, it often indicates a complex or non-obvious root cause. Continuously attempting small, incremental fixes on the main, complex component can be inefficient and can lead to regressions.

The goal of the **"Original-A-B-C" Testing Strategy** is to break this cycle by creating a test harness that runs the original, complex component in parallel with multiple, simplified, independent test components. Each test component attempts to solve the same basic problem using a slightly different technical approach, allowing for rapid diagnosis.

## 2. The Strategy

### 2.1. Core Principles
1.  **Preserve the Original:** Never gut or remove existing, working functionality to build a test case. The original component should remain available as the "control" in the experiment.
2.  **Isolate Variables:** Each test case should be as simple as possible, designed to test a single variable (e.g., raw event handling, local state updates, prop drilling).
3.  **Run in Parallel:** The original component and all test components should be accessible from the same UI, typically via a simple tab switcher, allowing for immediate comparison.

### 2.2. Steps
1.  **Identify the Core Problem:** Isolate the most fundamental action that is failing (e.g., "A click on a list item is not being registered").
2.  **Create Test Harness:** Refactor the main view to act as a "test harness."
    *   Introduce a top-level state to control which view is active (e.g., `activeView: 'Original' | 'TestA' | 'TestB'`).
    *   Create a simple tab bar UI to switch this state.
    *   Encapsulate the existing, complex component so it can be rendered when `activeView === 'Original'`.
3.  **Lift Necessary State:** Identify the minimum state required for the test components to function (e.g., `parsedContent`). Lift this state up to the test harness level. The "Original" component can then pass data up to the harness via a callback prop.
4.  **Implement Isolated Test Components:** Create new, simple components for each test case, which receive the shared state as props.
    *   **Test A (Barebones):** The simplest possible implementation. Use raw HTML elements with inline event handlers that only `logger.log()`.
    *   **Test B (Local State):** Introduce `useState` to test the component's ability to manage its own state and re-render on an event.
    *   **Test C (Prop-Driven):** Use a child component that calls a function passed down via props, testing the prop-drilling pattern.
5.  **Analyze Results:** Interact with each tab to see which implementation succeeds, thereby isolating the architectural pattern that is failing.

## 3. Cleanup Process

Once a working pattern is identified in a test component:
1.  **Codify Findings:** Document the successful pattern and the root cause of the failure in a relevant artifact (e.g., `A11. Regression Case Studies`).
2.  **Integrate Solution:** Refactor the "Original" component to use the successful pattern.
3.  **Remove Test Artifacts:**
    *   Remove the test harness tabs and view-switching logic from the main view component.
    *   Delete the temporary `TestPane*.tsx` component files.
    *   Remove any extra styling related to the test harness from the SCSS file.

## 4. Sample Test Data for Parser

To ensure consistent testing of the PCPP parser, use the following sample raw response. Paste this into a response tab in the "Original" view and click "Parse All".

```
I've analyzed the request and the provided context. The main goal is to add a new test harness to the Parallel Co-Pilot panel without removing the existing functionality. This involves refactoring `view.tsx` to support multiple, switchable views.

### Course of Action

1.  **Update Documentation:** I will first update `A51` to reflect the new "Original-A-B-C" parallel testing strategy.
2.  **Refactor `view.tsx`:** I will refactor the main component into a test harness that can switch between the original view and the new test panes.
3.  **Re-supply Test Panes:** I will provide the code for the three isolated test panes again.
