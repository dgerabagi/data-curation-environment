## 1. Overview & Goal

This document explores potential high-impact features that could be built on top of the core Parallel Co-Pilot panel. The goal is to move beyond simple "swap" functionality and create a more powerful, integrated, and intelligent workflow for reviewing and applying AI-generated code. These ideas are intended for consideration and prioritization during Phase 2 development.

## 2. Proposed Advanced Features

### 2.1. Idea: Apply as Diff/Patch

-   **Problem:** The current "swap" feature is a blunt instrument. It replaces the entire file, which can be risky if the AI only intended to change a small part of it and made a mistake elsewhere. It also makes it hard to see exactly what changed.
-   **Proposed Solution:**
    1.  **Diff Generation:** When an AI response is pasted into a tab, the extension automatically generates a diff between the tab's content and the original source file.
    2.  **Inline Diff View:** The editor in the tab could be enhanced to show an inline diff view (similar to VS Code's source control view), highlighting added and removed lines.
    3.  **"Apply Patch" Button:** The "Swap" button is replaced with an "Apply Patch" button. Clicking it would attempt to apply only the identified changes to the source file, leaving the rest of the file untouched. This is a much safer and more precise way to integrate AI suggestions.
-   **Technical Notes:** This would require a diffing library (e.g., `diff-match-patch` or `jsdiff`) on the frontend or backend to generate and apply patches.

### 2.2. Idea: Integrated Git Workflow

-   **Problem:** After a developer tests and accepts an AI suggestion, the next step is almost always to commit the change. This requires leaving the co-pilot panel and using the source control view.
-   **Proposed Solution:**
    1.  **"Commit This Change" Button:** Add a new button to each tab in the Parallel Co-Pilot panel.
    2.  **Workflow:**
        *   The user swaps in the AI code and verifies it works.
        *   They click "Commit This Change".
        *   The extension automatically stages the modified file (`git add <file_path>`).
        *   The extension opens the Source Control commit input box.
        *   **Enhancement:** The commit message box could be pre-populated with a summary of the changes, potentially generated by another AI call based on the diff.
-   **Technical Notes:** This requires deeper integration with the `vscode.git` extension API to programmatically stage files and interact with the commit box.

### 2.3. Idea: Response Annotation and Rating

-   **Problem:** It's difficult to remember why a particular AI response was good or bad, especially when looking back at the history via the Cycle Navigator.
-   **Proposed Solution:**
    1.  **Rating/Annotation UI:** Add a small section to each tab allowing the user to give a thumbs up/down rating and add a short text note (e.g., "Works, but inefficient" or "Best solution, very clean").
    2.  **Persistence:** These annotations would be saved as part of the `dce_history.json` file, associated with that specific response.
    3.  **Benefit:** When navigating back through cycles, these notes would provide valuable context about the quality and outcome of each AI suggestion, enhancing the "knowledge graph" of the project.
-   **Technical Notes:** This requires extending the data model in `A39` and adding the corresponding UI elements and state management.
