## **I. General & Philosophy**

### **Q: What is the Data Curation Environment (DCE)?**

**A:** The Data Curation Environment (DCE) is a VS Code extension designed to streamline and enhance the workflow of AI-assisted development. It provides an integrated toolset for selecting, managing, and packaging the context (code files, documents, etc.) you provide to Large Language Models (LLMs), and for managing the multiple responses you get back. Its primary goal is to solve the "context problem" by automating the tedious and error-prone process of manually preparing prompts for an AI.

### **Q: What problem does DCE solve?**

**A:** DCE solves two main problems:
1.  **Context Management:** Manually copying and pasting files, tracking which files you've included, and managing the size of your prompt is cumbersome. DCE automates this with a user-friendly interface.
2.  **Single-Threaded Interaction:** Standard AI chats are linear. DCE's "Parallel Co-Pilot Panel" allows you to manage, compare, and test multiple, parallel AI responses to the same prompt, dramatically speeding up the iterative process of finding the best solution.

### **Q: Who is DCE for?**

**A:** DCE is for any developer, project manager, researcher, or "Citizen Architect" who uses LLMs as part of their workflow. It's particularly powerful for those working on complex, multi-file projects who want a more structured, efficient, and auditable process for collaborating with AI.

### **Q: Is DCE free? Do I need an API key?**

**A:** Yes, the DCE extension is free. The default "Manual Mode" does not require any API keys. It's a "bring your own AI" workflow where DCE helps you generate a `prompt.md` file, which you can then copy and paste into any AI service you prefer, including free services like Google's AI Studio. This allows you to leverage powerful models without incurring API costs.

### **Q: What is the "Process as Asset" philosophy?**

**A:** This is the core idea that the *process* of developing with AI—the curated context, the prompts, the multiple AI responses, and the developer's final choice—is itself a valuable, auditable, and reusable asset. DCE is built to capture this process in a structured way through its "Cycle" system, creating a persistent knowledge graph of your project's evolution.

### **Q: What is "Vibecoding"?**

**A:** "Vibecoding" is a term for the intuitive, conversational, and iterative process of collaborating with an AI to create something new. It starts with a high-level goal or "vibe" and progressively refines it into a functional product through a human-machine partnership. DCE is the professional toolset for serious vibecoding.

## **II. Installation & Setup**

### **Q: How do I install the DCE extension?**

**A:** The DCE is not currently available on the VS Code Marketplace. It is distributed as a `.vsix` file from the `aiascent.dev` website. To install it, follow these steps:
1.  Download the `.vsix` file.
2.  Open VS Code and go to the **Extensions** view in the Activity Bar (or press `Ctrl+Shift+X`).
3.  Click the **...** (More Actions) button at the top-right of the Extensions view.
4.  Select **"Install from VSIX..."** from the dropdown menu.
5.  In the file dialog that opens, navigate to and select the `.vsix` file you downloaded.
6.  VS Code will install the extension and prompt you to reload the window.

### **Q: What are the prerequisites?**

**A:** You need to have Visual Studio Code and `git` installed on your machine. The extension works best when your project is a Git repository, as this enables the powerful "Baseline" and "Restore" features for safe code testing.

### **Q: How do I start a new project with DCE?**

**A:** Simply open a new, empty folder in VS Code. The DCE panel will automatically open to an "Onboarding" view. Describe your project's goal in the "Project Scope" text area and click "Generate Initial Artifacts Prompt." This will create a `prompt.md` file and a starter set of planning documents (called "Artifacts") to bootstrap your project.

### **Q: Why does DCE create documentation first instead of code?**

**A:** This is part of the "Documentation First" philosophy. By establishing a clear plan, vision, and set of requirements in documentation artifacts, you provide a stable "source of truth" that guides all subsequent code generation. This leads to more coherent and aligned results from the AI and creates a valuable, auditable history of your project's design decisions.

## **III. The Core Workflow**

### **Q: What is the recommended "perfect loop" workflow?**

**A:** The ideal workflow is a guided, iterative process that DCE facilitates:
1.  **Curate & Prompt:** Use the Context Chooser to select files, write your instructions in the "Cycle Context," and generate a `prompt.md`.
2.  **Paste & Parse:** Get multiple AI responses and paste them into the Parallel Co-Pilot Panel (PCPP), then use "Parse All".
3.  **Select:** Review the parsed responses and click "Select This Response" on the best one.
4.  **Baseline:** Create a `git commit` restore point with the "Baseline" button.
5.  **Accept & Test:** In the "Associated Files" list, check the files you want to apply and click "Accept Selected". Then, test the changes in your application.
6.  **(If needed) Restore:** If the changes are bad, click "Restore Baseline" to revert everything instantly.
7.  **Finalize & Repeat:** Once you're happy, write your notes for the next task in the "Cycle Context" and "Cycle Title" fields, then start the next cycle.

### **Q: What is an "Artifact"?**

**A:** An "Artifact" is a formal, written document (like a project plan, this FAQ, or a requirements doc) that serves as a "source of truth" for your project. They are stored in the `src/Artifacts` directory and are the blueprints that guide development.

### **Q: What are "Cycles"?**

**A:** A "Cycle" represents one full loop of the development process. The DCE organizes your entire project history into these numbered cycles, allowing you to use the Cycle Navigator in the PCPP to move back and forth in time, reviewing the exact context and AI suggestions from any point in your project's history.

### **Q: What is the difference between "Cycle Context" and "Ephemeral Context"?**

**A:**
*   **Cycle Context:** This is for your main instructions and goals for the current cycle. This content is saved and becomes part of the permanent history of your project.
*   **Ephemeral Context:** This is for temporary information that is only relevant for the *current* prompt generation, such as error logs or a snippet of code you want the AI to analyze. This content is **not** saved in the cycle history to keep it clean.

## **IV. Features: Context Curation (File Tree View)**

### **Q: How do I select files to include in the context for the AI?**

**A:** You use the File Tree View (FTV), which is the panel with the spiral icon. It shows your entire workspace with checkboxes next to each file and folder. Simply check the items you want to include. The FTV also shows you token counts, file counts, and Git status for your project.

### **Q: What does "Flatten Context" do?**

**A:** "Flattening" is the process of taking all the files you've selected (checked) and concatenating their content into a single file, `flattened_repo.md`. This file, along with your cycle history and instructions, becomes part of the `prompt.md` that you send to the AI.

### **Q: Can DCE handle different file types like PDFs or Excel sheets?**

**A:** Yes. DCE has built-in extractors for various file types. When you check a `.pdf`, `.docx` (Word), or `.xlsx`/`.csv` (Excel) file, DCE automatically extracts the textual content and converts it into a readable format (like Markdown for tables) to be included in the flattened context.

### **Q: Why are some folders or files grayed out and un-selectable?**

**A:** The DCE automatically excludes common directories that shouldn't be included in an AI's context, such as `node_modules`, `.git`, `.vscode`, and build output folders like `dist`. This is to keep your context focused, reduce token count, and prevent errors.

## **V. Features: The Parallel Co-Pilot Panel (PCPP)**

### **Q: Why should I use multiple responses?**

**A:** LLMs are non-deterministic; asking the same question multiple times can yield vastly different solutions. The Parallel Co-Pilot Panel is designed to manage this. It allows you to generate and compare 4, 8, or more responses at once to find the most elegant, efficient, or creative solution.

### **Q: What does the "Parse All" button do?**

**A:** After you paste raw AI responses into the tabs, the "Parse All" button processes them. It automatically identifies the AI's summary, its plan, and any code blocks, transforming the raw text into a structured, easy-to-read view with syntax highlighting and file association.

### **Q: What are "Associated Files" and how does the diffing work?**

**A:** When a response is parsed, DCE lists all the files the AI intended to modify under "Associated Files." You can click the "Open Changes" icon next to any file to open VS Code's built-in, side-by-side diff viewer, showing a precise comparison between your current file and the version suggested by the AI.

### **Q: What do the "Baseline (Commit)" and "Restore Baseline" buttons do?**

**A:** These buttons integrate DCE with Git to provide a safe testing loop. "Baseline" creates a Git commit of your current work, creating a restore point. After you "Accept" an AI's changes, you can test them. If they're buggy, one click on "Restore Baseline" instantly discards all those changes and reverts your workspace, allowing you to test a different response without manual cleanup.

## **VI. Local LLM & Demo Mode**

### **Q: Can I use DCE with a local LLM?**

**A:** Yes. DCE supports connecting to any OpenAI-compatible API endpoint. You can run a model locally using a tool like vLLM, Ollama, or LM Studio, and then enter its URL (e.g., `http://localhost:8000/v1`) in the DCE settings panel to have the extension communicate directly with your local model.

### **Q: What is "Demo Mode"?**

**A:** "Demo Mode" is a pre-configured setting that connects the DCE extension to a specific, high-performance vLLM instance. When in this mode, the "Generate prompt.md" button is replaced with a "Generate responses" button, which fully automates the process of sending the prompt and streaming the responses back into the UI in real-time.

### **Q: What is the Response Progress UI?**

**A:** When using an automated connection mode like "Demo Mode," a special UI appears during generation. It shows real-time progress bars for each parallel response, token-per-second metrics, status indicators ("Thinking," "Generating," "Complete"), and timers. This gives you full visibility into the generation process.

## **VII. Troubleshooting**

### **Q: My file tree is flashing or constantly refreshing. How do I fix it?**

**A:** This is almost always caused by the DCE's auto-save feature writing to the `.vscode/dce_history.json` file, which then triggers the file watcher to refresh the tree. To fix this, you must add `.vscode/` to your project's `.gitignore` file.

### **Q: Parsing failed or looks incorrect. What can I do?**

**A:** Parsing failures can happen if the AI doesn't format its response correctly. You can click "Un-Parse All" to return to the raw text view. Often, you can fix the issue by manually adding a missing tag (like `<summary>...</summary>`) or correcting a malformed file tag (`<file path="...">...
