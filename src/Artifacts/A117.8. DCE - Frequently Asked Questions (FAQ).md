## 1. Purpose

This document provides answers to common questions about the Data Curation Environment (DCE) VS Code extension. It is designed to help new and existing users understand the purpose, features, and workflow of the tool.

## 2. General Concepts & Workflow

### What is the Data Curation Environment (DCE)?
The Data Curation Environment is a VS Code extension designed to streamline and enhance the workflow of AI-assisted development. Its primary goal is to solve the problem of "context management"—the difficult and manual process of selecting, packaging, and managing the code and documents you provide to a Large Language Model (LLM) to get high-quality, relevant responses.

### What is the "artifact-driven workflow"?
This is the core philosophy of the DCE. It's a "documentation-first" approach where you create or update planning documents (called "Artifacts") before you write code. These artifacts act as the "source of truth" for your project, ensuring that both you and your AI collaborator are always aligned on the project's goals and architecture.

### What are "Cycles"?
Cycles are the primary unit of work and history in the DCE. Every time you prepare a prompt, get responses from an AI, and integrate the changes, you are completing a cycle. The Parallel Co-Pilot Panel allows you to navigate through your project's history, cycle by cycle, to see how it has evolved.

### What is the purpose of `prompt.md`?
The `prompt.md` file is the final, assembled context that you provide to an LLM. The DCE helps you generate this file by combining your project scope, cycle history, interaction rules, and the "flattened" content of all the files you've selected.

## 3. Phase 1: The Context Chooser (File Tree View)

### How do I select files to include in my prompt?
The Context Chooser is the file tree view marked with a spiral icon. You can include files and folders in your prompt context by simply clicking the checkbox next to their name. Checking a folder will automatically check all the files and subfolders within it.

### What does the "Flatten Context" button do?
This button takes all the files you have "checked" in the file tree, reads their content, and concatenates them into a single file called `flattened_repo.md` in your project's root directory. This file is then used as part of the `prompt.md`.

### Why do some files and folders have a grayed-out checkbox?
These are items that are excluded by default to keep your context clean and relevant. This includes directories like `.git`, `node_modules`, and `dist`, as well as specific files like `package-lock.json`. This prevents large, unnecessary, or build-related files from being included in your prompt.

### Can I save a set of selected files to use later?
Yes. The toolbar in the Context Chooser view has "Save," "Load," and "Manage" buttons for "Selection Sets." This allows you to save a specific group of checked files with a name (e.g., "Frontend Components") and quickly load that selection back in a future session.

## 4. Phase 2: The Parallel Co-Pilot Panel (PCPP)

### What is the Parallel Co-Pilot Panel?
The PCPP is the main interface for managing the iterative cycle-based workflow. It's a multi-tabbed environment where you can paste, parse, compare, and test multiple different responses from an AI for a single prompt.

### How do I use the PCPP?
1.  **Paste Responses:** After getting responses from your LLM (using the generated `prompt.md`), you paste each full response into a separate "Resp #" tab.
2.  **Parse:** Click the "Parse All" button. The DCE will read the raw text in each tab and structure it, separating the AI's summary and plan from the code files it generated.
3.  **Review & Compare:** You can now easily switch between tabs to compare the different solutions. The UI shows you which files were modified and provides a similarity score.
4.  **Diff:** Click on any file in the "Associated Files" list to open a native VS Code diff view, showing you the exact changes the AI is proposing.
5.  **Accept & Test:** Use the "Accept Selected" button to write the AI's proposed file changes directly into your workspace, allowing you to immediately test them.
6.  **Baseline/Restore:** The Git-integrated "Baseline" and "Restore" buttons allow you to create a safe save point before accepting changes and instantly revert your workspace if you don't like the AI's suggestion.

### What is the "animated workflow guide"?
This is a feature that highlights the next logical button you should press in the UI with a pulsing blue glow. It's designed to guide new users through the standard development cycle, from parsing responses to generating the prompt for the next cycle.

## 5. Local LLM / "Demo Mode"

### Can I use the DCE with a local LLM?
Yes. The DCE is designed to support different "Connection Modes." While the default is "Manual" (copy/paste), you can configure it to connect to a local LLM that exposes an OpenAI-compatible API endpoint (like vLLM or LM Studio).

### What is "Demo Mode"?
"Demo Mode" is a pre-configured setting that connects the DCE to a specific local vLLM instance running on the `aiascent.game` server. When this mode is active, the "Generate prompt.md" button is replaced with a "Generate responses" button, which automates the entire process of sending the prompt and receiving the responses directly within the extension.

### What is the Response Progress UI?
When you use an automated connection mode like "Demo Mode," a special UI appears while the responses are being generated. It shows real-time progress bars for each response, token counts, and performance metrics like tokens-per-second, providing feedback during the generation process.

## 6. Setup & Troubleshooting

### How do I get started with a new project?
When you open a new, empty folder with the DCE installed, the Parallel Co-Pilot Panel will automatically open to an "Onboarding View." Simply describe your project's goals in the text box and click "Generate Initial Artifacts Prompt." This will create a starter set of planning documents and the `prompt.md` file you need for your first cycle.

### Why is the File Tree View (FTV) flashing or constantly refreshing?
This can happen if the file watcher is reacting to frequent file changes. A common cause is the `dce_history.json` file being saved in the `.vscode` directory, which is not ignored by default. Adding `.vscode/` to your project's `.gitignore` file usually resolves this issue.
