# Artifact A2: DCE - Phase 1 - Context Chooser - Requirements & Design
# Date Created: Cycle 1
# Author: AI Model
# Updated on: C46 (Remove requirement for ignoring binary files, per A29)

## 1. Overview

This document outlines the requirements for Phase 1 of the Data Curation Environment (DCE) project. The primary goal of this phase is to replace the manual, error-prone process of managing context via a `files_list.txt` with an intuitive, UI-driven approach within VS Code.

**Major Update (Cycle 2):** The analysis of the `The-Creator-AI-main` repository revealed an existing, highly-functional file tree component (`src/client/components/file-tree/FileTree.tsx`) with checkbox selection. The project requirements have been updated to reflect a shift from *building* this component from scratch to *analyzing, adapting, and integrating* the existing solution.

## 2. Functional Requirements

| ID | Requirement | User Story | Acceptance Criteria | Update (Cycle 2) |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| FR-01 | **Analyze Existing File Tree** | As a developer, I want to understand the capabilities of the `FileTree.tsx` component | - Analyze the component's props and state. <br> - Document its dependencies on other frontend components and backend services (`FSService`). <br> - Determine how checkbox state is managed and communicated. | **New** |
| FR-02 | **Display File Tree in View** | As a user, I want to see a tree of all files and folders in my workspace within a dedicated VS Code view. | - The view should accurately reflect the workspace's file system structure. <br> - It should respect `.gitignore` rules to hide irrelevant files. | **Adaptation.** The `FileTree.tsx` component and `FSService` already provide this. We need to ensure it's correctly instantiated in our extension's view. |
| FR-03 | **Checkbox Selection** | As a user, I want to select and deselect files and folders for my context using checkboxes. | - Every file and folder in the tree has a checkbox. <br> - Checking a folder checks all its children. <br> - Unchecking a folder unchecks all its children. <br> - A folder shows an "indeterminate" state if only some of its children are checked. | **Adaptation.** The reference component appears to support this logic. We must verify and adapt its state management (`selectedFiles` array). |
| FR-04 | **Flatten Selected Context** | As a user, I want a single button to package all my selected files into one context file. | - A "Flatten Context" button is present in the view. <br> - Clicking it triggers a process that reads the content of all checked files. <br> - The contents are concatenated into a single `flattened_repo.md` file in the project root. | **Implementation.** The logic for this will need to be implemented, using the state from the `FileTree` component as input for our enhanced `bootstrap-flattener.js` logic. |
| FR-05 | **Handle Binary Files** | As a user, I want to be able to select binary/image files to include their metadata in the context, without including their raw content. | - All files, including binary and image files, are selectable via their checkbox. <br> - When a binary/image file is selected and flattened, only its metadata (path, size, type) is included in `flattened_repo.md`. <br> - See `A29` for the full strategy. | **Revised (C46)** |
