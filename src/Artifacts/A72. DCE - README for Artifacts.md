# Artifact A72: DCE - README for Artifacts
# Date Created: C158
# Author: AI Model & Curator
# Updated on: C128 (Enhanced Git initialization instructions)

- **Key/Value for A0:**
- **Description:** The content for the `README.md` file that is automatically created in a new project's `src/Artifacts` directory, explaining the purpose of the extension and the artifact-driven workflow.
- **Tags:** documentation, onboarding, readme, source of truth

## 1. Welcome to the Data Curation Environment (DCE)

This directory (`src/Artifacts/`) is the heart of your project's planning and documentation. It's managed by the **Data Curation Environment (DCE)**, a VS Code extension designed to streamline AI-assisted development.

This `README.md` file was automatically generated to provide context for you (the developer) and for the AI assistants you will be working with.

## 2. What is an "Artifact"?

In the context of this workflow, an **Artifact** is a formal, written document that serves as a "source of truth" for a specific part of your project. Think of these files as the official blueprints, plans, and records.

The core principle of the DCE workflow is **"Documentation First."** Before writing code, you and your AI partner should first create or update an artifact that describes the plan.

## 3. The Iterative Cycle Workflow

Development in the DCE is organized into **Cycles**. You have just completed the initial setup.

### Your Next Steps (CRITICAL)

To take full advantage of the DCE's features—especially the "Baseline" and "Restore" buttons for safe testing—you **must** initialize a Git repository for this project.

**Do this now:**

1.  Open a terminal in your project's root directory (VS Code menu: `Terminal > New Terminal`).
2.  Run the following commands in order:

    ```bash
    # 1. Initialize the repository
    git init

    # 2. Create a .gitignore file to exclude DCE system files
    # This is CRITICAL to prevent the extension from flashing/refreshing constantly.
    echo ".vscode/" >> .gitignore
    echo "node_modules/" >> .gitignore

    # 3. Stage all current files
    git add .

    # 4. Create your first commit
    git commit -m "Initial commit: DCE Project Setup"
    ```

3.  **Submit Your First Prompt:** The `prompt.md` file has been automatically generated for you. It contains your project plan and instructions. Copy its entire contents and paste it into your preferred AI chat interface (e.g., Google AI Studio, ChatGPT).

4.  **Review and Accept Responses:** Paste the AI's responses back into the "Resp 1", "Resp 2", etc. tabs in the Parallel Co-Pilot panel. The UI will guide you through parsing the responses, selecting the best one, and accepting its changes into your workspace.

5.  **Repeat:** This completes a cycle. You then start the next cycle, building upon the newly accepted code and documentation.
