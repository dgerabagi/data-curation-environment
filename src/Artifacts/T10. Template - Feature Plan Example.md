# Artifact T10: Template - Feature Plan Example
# Date Created: C141
# Author: AI Model & Curator

- **Key/Value for A0:**
- **Description:** A generic template for a feature plan, using a right-click context menu as an example.
- **Tags:** template, cycle 0, documentation, project setup

## 1. Overview & Goal

This document outlines the plan for implementing a standard right-click context menu. The goal is to provide essential management operations directly within the application, reducing the need for users to switch contexts for common tasks.

## 2. User Stories

| ID | User Story | Acceptance Criteria |
|---|---|---|
| US-01 | **Copy Item Name** | As a user, I want to right-click an item and copy its name to my clipboard, so I can easily reference it elsewhere. | - Right-clicking an item opens a context menu. <br> - The menu contains a "Copy Name" option. <br> - Selecting the option copies the item's name string to the system clipboard. |
| US-02 | **Rename Item** | As a user, I want to right-click an item and rename it, so I can correct mistakes or update its label. | - The context menu contains a "Rename" option. <br> - Selecting it turns the item's name into an editable input field. <br> - Pressing Enter or clicking away saves the new name. |
| US-03 | **Delete Item** | As a user, I want to right-click an item and delete it, so I can remove unnecessary items. | - The context menu contains a "Delete" option. <br> - Selecting it shows a confirmation dialog to prevent accidental deletion. <br> - Upon confirmation, the item is removed. |

## 3. Technical Implementation Plan

-   **State Management:** Introduce new state to manage the context menu's visibility and position: `const [contextMenu, setContextMenu] = useState<{ x: number; y: number; item: any } | null>(null);`.
-   **Event Handling:** Add an `onContextMenu` handler to the item element. This will prevent the default browser menu and set the state to show our custom menu at the event's coordinates.
-   **New Menu Component:** Render a custom context menu component conditionally based on the `contextMenu` state. It will contain the options defined in the user stories.
-   **Action Handlers:** Implement the functions for `handleRename`, `handleDelete`, etc. These will be called by the menu items' `onClick` handlers.
-   **Overlay:** An overlay will be added to the entire screen when the menu is open. Clicking this overlay will close the menu.
