# Artifact A14: DCE - Ongoing Development Issues
# Date Created: C20
# Author: AI Model & Curator
# Updated on: C23 (Add issues for selection persistence and remove button)

- **Key/Value for A0:**
- **Description:** A tracking document for recurring or persistent issues that need to be monitored across development cycles until they are confirmed as resolved.
- **Tags:** bugs, tracking, issues, logging, node_modules, performance

## 1. Purpose

This artifact serves as a centralized list to track ongoing and recurring issues during the development of the Data Curation Environment (DCE) extension. This ensures that persistent problems are not forgotten and are actively monitored across cycles until a definitive solution is implemented and verified.

## 2. Active Issues

### Issue #5: Selection State is Not Persistent

-   **Symptom:** When the user makes selections in the "Data Curation" view, then switches to another VS Code tab and back, all selections are lost.
-   **First Reported:** Cycle 23
-   **Status (C23):** **Active.** The frontend state for `selectedFiles` is not being persisted in the VS Code `workspaceState`.
-   **Next Steps (C23):** Implement a mechanism to save the `selectedFiles` array to `workspaceState` on every change and load it when the view is initialized. This will involve both frontend (`view.tsx`) and backend (`selection.service.ts`) changes.

### Issue #6: "Remove selected" Button is Non-Functional

-   **Symptom:** In the "Selected Items" view, selecting one or more files and clicking the "Remove selected" button does not remove them from the list or from the main selection. It also causes the file tree in the main view to collapse.
-   **First Reported:** Cycle 23
-   **Status (C23):** **Active.** The logic in `removePathsFromSelected` or the way its result is being used to update the state is flawed. The tree collapsing indicates an improper state update is causing a major re-render.
-   **Next Steps (C23):** Debug the `removePathsFromSelected` function in `FileTree.utils.ts`. Add logging to the `onClick` handler in `SelectedFilesView.tsx` to trace the data flow. Fix the state update to prevent the side-effect of collapsing the tree.

### Issue #1: Logging Visibility

-   **Symptom:** The custom "Data Curation Environment" output channel is not visible in the "OUTPUT" tab's dropdown menu in the Extension Development Host window. This prevents the primary logging mechanism from being used for debugging.
-   **First Reported:** Cycle 19
-   **Status (C23):** **Resolved (C21).** The issue was caused by an early-exit error during extension activation. Adding robust `try...catch` blocks around service initializations in `extension.ts` allowed the extension to fully load, making the output channel visible.

---

### Issue #2: `node_modules` Exclusion and Performance

-   **Symptom:** The `node_modules` directory is included in file tree scans, leading to incorrect file and token counts and a significant performance delay.
-   **First Reported:** Cycle 15 (and earlier)
-   **Status (C23):** **Resolved (C20).** The `vscode.workspace.findFiles` call in `fs.service.ts` was updated with a more robust glob pattern `'{**/node_modules/**,**/dist/**,**/out/**,**/.git/**,**/flattened_repo.md}'` which now correctly excludes these directories.

---

### Issue #3: Incorrect Image Token Counting

-   **Symptom:** Image files are being assigned a token count instead of displaying their file size.
-   **First Reported:** Cycle 18
-   **Status (C23):** **Resolved (C20).** The logic in `fs.service.ts` was corrected to identify images by extension, set `tokenCount` to 0, and get their `sizeInBytes`. The frontend (`FileTree.tsx`) now uses an `isImage` flag to display the formatted byte size instead of tokens.

---

### Issue #4: File Tree Caching and Refresh Behavior

-   **Symptom:** The file tree reloaded from scratch on every tab switch and did not auto-update on file changes.
-   **First Reported:** Cycle 19
-   **Status (C23):** **Resolved (C20).** A frontend cache was implemented by changing the `useEffect` dependency array. A backend `FileSystemWatcher` was implemented in `fs.service.ts` to detect changes and push updates to the client, triggering a refresh.
