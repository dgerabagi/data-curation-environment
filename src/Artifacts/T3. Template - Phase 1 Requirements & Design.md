## 2. Functional Requirements

| ID | Requirement | User Story | Acceptance Criteria |
|---|---|---|---|
| FR-01 | **[Feature Name]** | As a [user type], I want to [perform an action], so that [I can achieve a goal]. | - [Criterion 1: A specific, testable outcome] <br> - [Criterion 2: Another specific, testable outcome] |
| FR-02 | **[Another Feature Name]** | As a [user type], I want to [perform an action], so that [I can achieve a goal]. | - [Criterion 1] <br> - [Criterion 2] |

## 3. Non-Functional Requirements

| ID | Requirement | Description |
|---|---|---|
| NFR-01 | **Performance** | The core action of [describe action] should complete in under [time, e.g., 500ms]. |
| NFR-02 | **Usability** | The user interface should be intuitive and follow standard design conventions for [platform, e.g., web applications]. |

## 4. High-Level Design

The implementation of Phase 1 will involve the following components:
-   **[Component A]:** Responsible for [its primary function].
