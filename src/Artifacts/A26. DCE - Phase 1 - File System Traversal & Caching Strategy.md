# Artifact A26: DCE - Phase 1 - File System Traversal & Caching Strategy
# Date Created: C31
# Author: AI Model
# Updated on: C152 (Update node_modules handling)

- **Key/Value for A0:**
- **Description:** Documents the root cause of the folder visibility bug and outlines the new strategy of using recursive directory traversal instead of `findFiles` to build a complete and accurate file system map. Also defines the performance-oriented handling of `node_modules`.
- **Tags:** bug fix, file system, traversal, refresh, cache, architecture, performance

## 1. Overview & Goal

This document addresses a critical bug where newly created empty folders do not appear in the Data Curation file tree. It also defines the strategy for handling large directories like `node_modules` to ensure the UI remains performant. The goal is to define a robust file system traversal strategy that guarantees an accurate and fast representation of the workspace.

## 2. Root Cause Analysis (RCA) - Folder Visibility

-   **Symptom:** Creating a new, empty folder in the workspace does not result in that folder appearing in the DCE file tree, even after a refresh.
-   **Root Cause:** The file discovery mechanism was using `vscode.workspace.findFiles("**/*", ...)`. This API is optimized to return a flat list of **files** and does **not** return directories, especially empty ones. When the tree was reconstructed from this file-only list, empty directories were invisible.

## 3. New Traversal Strategy

To resolve this, the reliance on `vscode.workspace.findFiles` for building the tree structure has been replaced with a manual, recursive directory traversal.

### 3.1. Technical Implementation Plan

1.  **Primary API:** The new strategy is centered around `vscode.workspace.fs.readDirectory(uri)`. This function returns an array of `[name, fileType]` tuples for all immediate children of a given directory.
2.  **Recursive Function:** A `private async _traverseDirectory(uri)` method in `file-tree.service.ts` implements the recursive scan. It iterates through directory contents, creating `FileNode` objects and recursively calling itself for subdirectories.

## 4. Performance Strategy for `node_modules` (C152)

-   **Problem:** Scanning `node_modules` for file and token counts is extremely slow and provides no value for context curation. However, completely hiding it can be confusing if a user needs to reference its structure.
-   **New Strategy:** The `node_modules` directory will be **visible but not counted**.
-   **Implementation (`_traverseDirectory`):**
    1.  When the traversal encounters a directory named `node_modules`, it will **not** skip it. It will create a `FileNode` for it.
    2.  However, it will **not** recursively call `_traverseDirectory` on its contents.
    3.  The `FileNode` for `node_modules` will be returned with an empty `children` array and `fileCount`/`tokenCount` set to 0.
-   **Benefit:** This approach makes the UI load instantly while still showing the `node_modules` folder in the tree, achieving the best of both worlds. The `flattener.service.ts` will continue to explicitly ignore this directory to prevent its inclusion in the flattened output.

## 5. Benefits of the New Approach

-   **Accuracy:** The method builds a true representation of the file system, including empty directories.
-   **Performance:** By special-casing `node_modules`, the initial tree scan remains fast and responsive.
-   **Control:** It gives us full control over the traversal, allowing for sophisticated filtering and caching.
