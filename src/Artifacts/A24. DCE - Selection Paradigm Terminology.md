# Artifact A24: DCE - Selection Paradigm Terminology
# Date Created: C29
# Author: AI Model

- **Key/Value for A0:**
- **Description:** A document to clarify the terminology used within the project to distinguish between different types of user selections (e.g., "checking" for flattening vs. "selecting" for actions).
- **Tags:** documentation, terminology, selection, checking, design

## 1. Problem Statement

During development and feedback cycles, the term "select" has been used ambiguously, leading to confusion. It has been used to describe two distinct user actions with different purposes:
1.  Clicking a checkbox to include a file/folder in the context to be flattened.
2.  Clicking a file/folder row (with optional Ctrl/Shift modifiers) to highlight it for a contextual action (e.g., Rename, Delete).

This ambiguity makes feature requests and technical discussions difficult. The goal of this document is to establish clear, consistent terminology for use in all future artifacts, code, and discussions.

## 2. Defined Terminology

Henceforth, the following terms will be used to describe user interactions with the file tree:

### **Checking / Unchecking**

*   **Action:** Clicking the `checkbox` next to a file or folder item.
*   **Purpose:** To include or exclude an item from the set of files that will be processed by the **"Flatten Context"** action.
*   **UI State:** A visible checkmark (`✓`), indeterminate mark (`-`), or empty state in the checkbox.
*   **State Variable (conceptual):** `checkedPaths: Set<string>`
*   **User Phrasing:** "I **checked** the `src` folder."

### **Selecting / Highlighting**

*   **Action:** Single-clicking a file/folder row. Using `Ctrl+Click` or `Shift+Click` to highlight multiple rows.
*   **Purpose:** To designate one or more items as the target for a contextual action, such as those in the **right-click context menu** (e.g., Rename, Delete, Copy Path). This is also used to identify the "active" item for operations like "New File".
*   **UI State:** A visual highlight on the entire row, typically matching the VS Code theme's selection color.
*   **State Variable (conceptual):** `selectedPaths: Set<string>`
*   **User Phrasing:** "I **selected** three files and then right-clicked to delete them."

---

### **Focusing**

*   **Action:** Navigating the tree with keyboard arrow keys.
*   **Purpose:** To move a visual indicator (a focus ring or subtle highlight) to an item, making it the active target for keyboard actions (`Enter` to open, `Spacebar` to check/uncheck).
*   **UI State:** A focus outline around the item row.
*   **State Variable (conceptual):** `focusedPath: string | null`
*   **User Phrasing:** "The `README.md` file is currently **focused**."

## 3. Summary Table

| Term | Action | Purpose | UI Cue | State Name |
| :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **Check** | Click checkbox | Include in Flatten Context | Checkmark | `checkedPaths` |
| **Select** | Click / Ctrl+Click / Shift+Click row | Target for Context Menu Actions | Row highlight | `selectedPaths` |
| **Focus** | Keyboard navigation | Target for Keyboard Actions | Focus ring | `focusedPath` |

By adhering to this terminology, we can ensure clarity in communication and precision in our technical implementation.
