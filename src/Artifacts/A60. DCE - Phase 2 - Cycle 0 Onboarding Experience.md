- **Key/Value for A0:**
- **Description:** Documents the plan for a special "Cycle 0" mode to guide new users in setting up their project by generating an initial set of planning documents.
- **Tags:** feature plan, phase 2, onboarding, first-run, project setup

## 1. Vision & Goal

The Parallel Co-Pilot Panel (PCPP) is a powerful tool, but its effectiveness relies on a structured set of planning and documentation artifacts. For a new user, bootstrapping this structure is a major hurdle.

The goal of the "Cycle 0" onboarding experience is to automate this bootstrapping process. By capturing the user's high-level project scope and providing a curated set of best-practice **template artifacts** as a model, the extension will generate a prompt that instructs an AI to create a starter pack of essential **planning and documentation artifacts** for the user's new project. This introduces the user to the artifact-driven workflow and ensures the output is immediately parsable by the PCPP.

## 2. User Flow

1.  **Detection:** The extension detects a "fresh workspace" by confirming the absence of `src/Artifacts/A0. Master Artifact List.md`.
2.  **Cycle 0 UI:** The PCPP loads into a special "Cycle 0" view. It presents the user with an introduction and a single large text area for their "Project Scope".
3.  **User Input:** The user describes their project's vision and goals.
4.  **Generate Prompt & Artifacts:** The user clicks "Generate Initial Artifacts Prompt".
5.  **Backend Process:**
    *   The backend `PromptService` constructs a unique `prompt.md` file. The prompt's static context will contain the content of all template artifacts (files prefixed with `T` in `src/Artifacts`).
    *   The prompt instructs the AI to use the provided templates as a guide to create initial planning documents based on the user's scope.
    *   It creates the `src/Artifacts` directory and a new, generically named **`A0. Master Artifact List.md`**.
    *   It saves the user's "Project Scope" to a persistent field in `dce_history.json`.
6.  **Transition to Cycle 1:** The frontend reloads its state. Since `A0` now exists, the `HistoryService` returns Cycle 1, and the UI transitions to the main PCPP interface.
7.  **User Action:** The user takes the generated `prompt.md` and uses it with their preferred LLM.
8.  **First Iteration:** The user pastes the AI's response (which should contain the new, correctly formatted documentation artifacts) back into the PCPP's "Cycle 1" tab, and the standard iterative workflow begins.
9.  **Return to Cycle 0:** The user can navigate back to Cycle 0 to view and edit their master project scope, which will then be used in subsequent `prompt.md` generations.

## 3. Meta-Context Injection Process (C156)

To ensure the AI can always generate perfectly parsable responses, the DCE injects "meta-context" into the prompts for all cycles *after* Cycle 0. This process is automatic and transparent to the user.

-   **Cycle 0 (Bootstrapping):** Uses the curated `T` (template) artifacts as static context to guide the AI in creating initial *planning* documents for the user's project. The goal is to establish the project's structure.
-   **Cycle 1+ (Iterative Development):** The `prompt.service.ts` automatically reads and injects the following critical artifacts into the `<Cycle Context>` section of every generated `prompt.md`:
    -   **`A52.1 DCE - Parser Logic and AI Guidance.md`**: Contains the literal source code of the response parser, showing the AI exactly how its output will be interpreted.
    -   **`A52.2 DCE - Interaction Schema Source.md`**: Contains the canonical rules of interaction, ensuring the AI always has the latest formatting guidelines.

This "metainterpretability" approach is key to the reliability of the DCE, as it makes the AI an informed partner in the development process.
