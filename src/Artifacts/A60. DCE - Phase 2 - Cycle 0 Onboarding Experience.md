## 1. Vision & Goal

The Parallel Co-Pilot Panel (PCPP) is a powerful tool, but its effectiveness relies on a structured set of planning and documentation artifacts. For a new user, bootstrapping this structure is a major hurdle.

The goal of the "Cycle 0" onboarding experience is to automate this bootstrapping process. The extension will capture the user's high-level project scope and generate a prompt that instructs an AI to create a starter pack of essential **planning and documentation artifacts**. As part of this process, it will also create a `DCE_README.md` file within the `src/Artifacts` directory that explains the artifact-driven workflow itself, providing meta-context to both the user and the AI.

## 2. User Flow

1.  **Detection:** The extension detects a "fresh workspace" by confirming the absence of any `A0.*Master Artifact List.md` file in the `src/Artifacts/` directory.
2.  **Cycle 0 UI:** The PCPP loads into a special "Cycle 0" view. It presents the user with an introduction and a single large text area for their "Project Scope".
3.  **User Input:** The user describes their project's vision and goals.
4.  **Generate Prompt & Artifacts:** The user clicks "Generate Initial Artifacts Prompt".
5.  **Backend Process:**
    *   The backend `PromptService` constructs a unique `prompt.md` file. The prompt's static context will contain the content of all template artifacts (files prefixed with `T` in the extension's artifacts).
    *   **Prompt Instruction Refinement (C179):** The instructions within the generated prompt will be updated to strongly encourage the AI to generate a comprehensive set of initial artifacts. It will explicitly prioritize foundational documents like **`T14. Template - GitHub Repository Setup Guide.md`** and **`T7. Template - Development and Testing Guide.md`** to ensure the user receives critical operational guidance from the very beginning, addressing potential setup hurdles like Git initialization proactively.
    *   It creates `src/Artifacts/DCE_README.md`, populated with the content from the extension's internal `A72. DCE - README for Artifacts.md`.
    *   It saves the user's "Project Scope" to a persistent field in `dce_history.json`.
6.  **Transition to Cycle 1:** The frontend reloads its state. Since an `A0` file does not yet exist, the user is presented with a "Continue to Cycle 1" button. Clicking this transitions them to the main PCPP interface.
7.  **User Action:** The user takes the generated `prompt.md` and uses it with their preferred LLM.
8.  **First Iteration:** The user pastes the AI's response (which should contain the new, correctly formatted documentation artifacts, including a project-specific `A0` file) back into the PCPP's "Cycle 1" tab. The standard iterative workflow begins.
9.  **Return to Cycle 0:** The user can click the "Project Plan" button to navigate back to Cycle 0 to view and edit their master project scope. A "Return to Cycles" button will take them back to their latest cycle.

## 3. Meta-Context Injection Process

To ensure the AI can always generate perfectly parsable responses, the DCE injects "meta-context" into the prompts for all cycles *after* Cycle 0. This process is automatic and transparent to the user.

-   **Cycle 0 (Bootstrapping):** Uses the curated `T` (template) artifacts as static context to guide the AI in creating initial *planning* documents for the user's project. The goal is to establish the project's structure.
-   **Cycle 1+ (Iterative Development):** The `prompt.service.ts` automatically reads and injects the following critical artifacts into the `<M3. Interaction Schema>` section of every generated `prompt.md`:
    -   **`A52.1 DCE - Parser Logic and AI Guidance.md`**: Contains the literal source code of the response parser, showing the AI exactly how its output will be interpreted.
    -   **`A52.2 DCE - Interaction Schema Source.md`**: Contains the canonical rules of interaction, ensuring the AI always has the latest formatting guidelines.
