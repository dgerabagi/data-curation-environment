# Artifact A60: DCE - Phase 2 - Cycle 0 Onboarding Experience
# Date Created: C139
# Author: AI Model & Curator
# Updated on: C147 (Pivot goal from generating documents to generating initial project files)

- **Key/Value for A0:**
- **Description:** Documents the plan for a special "Cycle 0" mode to guide new users in setting up their project by having an AI generate an initial set of project files.
- **Tags:** feature plan, phase 2, onboarding, first-run, project setup, scaffolding

## 1. Vision & Goal

The Parallel Co-Pilot Panel (PCPP) is a powerful tool for iterative, AI-assisted development. However, for a new user starting a project from scratch, the initial setup can be a hurdle.

The goal of the "Cycle 0" onboarding experience has been refined. It is no longer about generating planning documents. The new, more powerful goal is to guide the user through the initial project scaffolding. By capturing their high-level project scope, the extension will leverage a set of best-practice document templates as *examples* to generate a prompt that instructs an AI to create a starter pack of **initial, runnable project files** (e.g., `package.json`, `src/main.ts`, etc.). This automates the project bootstrapping process and ensures the output is immediately parsable by the PCPP.

## 2. User Flow

1.  **Detection:** The extension detects a "fresh workspace" by confirming the absence of `src/Artifacts/A0. DCE Master Artifact List.md`.
2.  **Cycle 0 UI:** The PCPP loads into a special "Cycle 0" view. This view is simplified, removing the cycle navigator and response tabs. It presents the user with an introduction and a single large text area.
3.  **User Input:** The user is prompted to describe their project's vision and goals in the "Project Scope" text area.
4.  **Generate Prompt & Artifacts:** The user clicks a button, e.g., "Generate Initial Project Files Prompt".
5.  **Backend Process:**
    *   The backend `PromptService` constructs a unique `prompt.md` file. The prompt will contain strong instructions for the AI to act as a scaffolder and generate actual code/config files, not documents.
    *   Crucially, it also creates the `src/Artifacts` directory if it doesn't exist, and then creates an empty `src/Artifacts/A0. DCE Master Artifact List.md`.
    *   It then notifies the frontend that the process is complete.
6.  **Transition to Cycle 1:** Upon notification, the frontend automatically reloads its state. Since `A0` now exists, the `HistoryService` returns Cycle 1, and the UI transitions to the main PCPP interface, ready for the user's first real cycle.
7.  **User Action:** The user takes the generated `prompt.md` and uses it with their preferred LLM.
8.  **First Iteration:** The user pastes the AI's response (which should contain the new, correctly formatted project files) back into the PCPP's "Cycle 1" tab. The user can then parse the response and use the "Accept" functionality to write the new files to their workspace, instantly creating the project structure.

## 3. Technical Implementation

-   **Detection (`history.service.ts`):** The logic remains the same: check for `A0`. If missing, return `cycleId: 0`.
-   **Frontend (`view.tsx`, `OnboardingView.tsx`):** The UI components remain the same.
-   **Backend (`prompt.service.ts`):**
    *   The `generateCycle0Prompt` method will be heavily revised.
    *   It will construct a prompt with a new, explicit set of instructions emphasizing the generation of code files and the mandatory `<file path="...">` format.
    *   It will continue to use the template artifacts as examples of good documentation to provide context to the AI, but will instruct the AI not to generate them.
