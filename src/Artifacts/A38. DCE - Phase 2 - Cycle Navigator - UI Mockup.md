# Date Created: C70
# Author: AI Model

- **Key/Value for A0:**
- **Description:** Provides a textual mockup and interaction flow for the Cycle Navigator UI, including the cycle counter and navigation controls within the Parallel Co-Pilot Panel.
- **Tags:** feature plan, phase 2, ui, ux, mockup, workflow, cycle navigator

## 1. Overview

This document describes the proposed user interface (UI) for the Cycle Navigator. The design prioritizes simplicity and integration, placing the navigation controls directly within the Parallel Co-Pilot Panel, reinforcing the connection between the cycle history and the AI responses.

## 2. UI Mockup (Textual Description)

The Cycle Navigator will be a new UI element added to the top of the Parallel Co-Pilot Panel, positioned just below the main header and above the tab configuration slider.

### 2.1. UI Components Breakdown

1.  **Cycle Navigator Bar:**
    *   A new horizontal bar containing the navigation controls.
    *   **Label:** "Cycle:".
    *   **Previous Button (`<`):** A button with a left-arrow icon. Clicking it navigates to the previous cycle (e.g., `C69`). The button is disabled if the user is at the very first recorded cycle.
    *   **Cycle Display (`C70`):** A read-only (or potentially editable) text field showing the ID of the currently viewed cycle.
    *   **Next Button (`>`):** A button with a right-arrow icon. Clicking it navigates to the next cycle (e.g., `C71`). The button is disabled if the user is at the most recent cycle.

## 3. User Interaction Flow

1.  **Initial State:** The user is working on Cycle 70. The Cycle Display shows `C70`. The `>` button is disabled. The Parallel Co-Pilot tabs show the AI responses generated for Cycle 70.
2.  **Navigate Back:**
    *   The user clicks the **`<`** button.
    *   **Action:** The extension's state updates to the previous cycle, `C69`.
    *   **UI Update:** The Cycle Display changes to `C69`.
    *   **Data Load:** The Parallel Co-Pilot panel fetches the historical data for Cycle 69. The tabs are cleared and re-populated with the AI responses that were generated during that cycle. The metadata and similarity scores all update to reflect this historical data. Both `<` and `>` buttons are now enabled.
3.  **Navigate Forward:**
    *   The user is viewing Cycle 69 and clicks the **`>`** button.
    *   **Action:** The state moves forward to `C70`.
    *   **UI Update & Data Load:** The UI returns to the state described in step 1. The `>` button becomes disabled again.
