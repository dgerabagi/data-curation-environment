## 1. Overview & Goal

This document outlines a series of advanced user experience (UX) and automation features designed to further streamline the data curation workflow. The goal is to reduce manual steps, provide more insightful contextual information, and make the extension's UI more flexible and powerful.

## 2. User Stories

| ID | User Story | Acceptance Criteria |
|---|---|---|
| UXA-01 | **Auto-Reveal Flattened File** | As a user, after I click "Flatten Context," I want the newly created `flattened_repo.md` file to be automatically selected and revealed in the file tree, so I can immediately open it without searching. | - After the `flattened_repo.md` file is created or updated, it becomes the `activeFile` in the Data Curation view. <br> - The tree view automatically expands and scrolls to show the `flattened_repo.md` file. |
| UXA-02 | **Contextual Selected Count** | As a user, when I have files selected inside a folder, I want to see a count of how many files are selected within that folder, displayed next to the folder's total file count, so I can understand my selection density at a glance. | - Next to a folder's total file count, a secondary count in parentheses `(x)` appears. <br> - `x` represents the number of files within that folder (recursively) that are part of the current selection. <br> - This count only appears if `x` is greater than 0 and less than the folder's total file count. |
| UXA-03 | **Minimize Selection Panel** | As a user, once I've made my selection, I want to minimize the "Selected Items" list to reclaim vertical space while keeping the "Flatten Context" button accessible, so I can focus on the main file tree. | - A minimize/expand button is present in the "Selected Items" panel header. <br> - Clicking it collapses the list of selected files, but the panel's header, toolbar, and the main footer (with the Flatten button) remain visible. <br> - Clicking it again expands the list to its previous state. |
| UXA-04 | **Auto-Add New Files** | As a user, I want to enable an "auto-add" mode where any new file I create in the workspace is automatically added to my current selection, so I don't have to break my coding flow to manually check the new file. | - A toggle button or checkbox exists in the UI to enable/disable "Auto-Add New Files" mode. <br> - When enabled, any file created in the workspace is automatically added to the `selectedFiles` list. <br> - The file system watcher is responsible for detecting file creation and triggering this logic. <br> - The state of this toggle is persisted in the workspace state. |
| UXA-05 | **Resizable Panels** | As a user, I want to be able to click and drag the divider between the main file tree and the "Selected Items" panel to vertically resize them, so I can customize the layout to my needs. | - The horizontal divider between the two main panels is a draggable handle. <br> - Dragging it up or down resizes both panels accordingly, while respecting their minimum and maximum height constraints. |

## 3. Technical Implementation Plan

-   **Auto-Reveal (UXA-01):**
    -   Create a new IPC channel `ServerToClientChannel.FocusFile`.
    -   Backend (`flattener.service.ts`): After writing the file, send the `FocusFile` message with the file's absolute path. A small delay might be needed to allow the file watcher to trigger a UI refresh first.
    -   Frontend (`view.tsx`): Listen for `FocusFile` and call `setActiveFile` with the received path. The existing `useEffect` in `TreeView.tsx` will handle the reveal.
-   **Selected Count (UXA-02):**
    -   Frontend (`FileTree.tsx`): Implement a memoized recursive function that traverses a `FileNode`'s children and checks against the `selectedFiles` list to calculate the selected count. Render this count conditionally in the `renderFileNodeContent` function. This is a frontend-only calculation.
-   **Minimize Panel (UXA-03):**
    -   Frontend (`view.tsx`): Add a new state, `isSelectionListMinimized`.
    -   Frontend (`SelectedFilesView.tsx`): Add a button to the header that calls a prop function to toggle this state. Conditionally render the `<ul>` based on the state.
-   **Auto-Add Files (UXA-04):**
    -   Frontend (`view.tsx`): Add a toggle button and a state for this mode. When toggled, send an IPC message to the backend to update its persisted state.
    -   Backend (`selection.service.ts`): Store the toggle's state in `workspaceState`.
    -   Backend (`fs.service.ts`): The `onDidCreate` handler in the file watcher will check this state. If true, it will get the current selection, add the new file's path, and save it back using `selection.service.ts` before triggering the UI refresh.
