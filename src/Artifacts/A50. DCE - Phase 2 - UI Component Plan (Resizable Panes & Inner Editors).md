- **Key/Value for A0:**
- **Description:** Documents the plan for advanced UI components like resizable panes and nested, scrollable editors within the Parallel Co-Pilot panel.

## 1. Overview & Goal

As the Parallel Co-Pilot Panel (PCPP) becomes more feature-rich, its UI needs to be flexible and efficient. This document outlines the plan for two advanced UI components: a **resizable pane** for the summary/code view and a system of **nested, scrollable "inner editors"** for individual file blocks within a response. The goal is to create a highly readable and customizable interface that prevents "endless scrolling" and allows users to focus on the information that matters most to them.

## 2. User Stories

| ID | User Story | Acceptance Criteria |
|---|---|---|
| P2-UI-01 | **Resizable Panes** | As a developer, I want to be able to drag the vertical divider between the summary/file list pane and the code viewer pane, so I can give more space to the view that is most important for my current task. | - A draggable handle exists on the vertical divider between the two main panes in the parsed view. <br> - Clicking and dragging the handle adjusts the relative width of the two panes. <br> - The layout is responsive and does not break during resizing. <br> - The left pane should be collapsible. |
| P2-UI-02 | **Contained File Editors** | As a developer, when viewing a large AI response with multiple files, I want each file's code to be contained within its own fixed-height, scrollable text area, so I can quickly scroll past entire files without having to scroll through all of their content. | - The extension parses the AI response and identifies individual file blocks (e.g., content within `<file>` tags). <br> - Each file block is rendered inside its own container with a fixed `max-height` and `overflow-y: auto`. <br> - This allows the user to scroll through the list of files quickly, only scrolling within a specific file's content when needed. |
| P2-UI-03 | **File-Level Action Buttons** | As a developer, I want action buttons (like "Accept", "Diff", "Comment") to be associated with each individual file block within a response, so I can act on a single file at a time. | - In the "inner editor" view, each file container has its own set of action buttons. <br> - Clicking "Accept" on one file block only affects that specific file, not the entire response. |

## 3. Technical Implementation Plan

### 3.1. Resizable Panes (Priority for C112)

-   **Strategy:** Implement a custom, lightweight resizable pane component directly within `view.tsx`.
-   **Component Logic:**
    *   The main `.parsed-view-grid` will be the flex container.
    *   A new `div` element with a `.resizer` class will be added between the left and right panes to act as the draggable handle.
    *   **State:** A new state variable, `const [leftPaneWidth, setLeftPaneWidth] = useState(33);`, will manage the width of the left pane as a percentage.
    *   **Event Handling:**
        *   The resizer `div` will have an `onMouseDown` handler.
        *   This handler will attach `onMouseMove` and `onMouseUp` listeners to the `window`.
        *   The `onMouseMove` handler will calculate the new percentage width based on `event.clientX` and update the `leftPaneWidth` state, respecting min/max width constraints.
        *   The `onMouseUp` handler will remove the `mousemove` and `mouseup` listeners from the window.
-   **Integration:** The `style` attribute of the left pane will be bound to this state (e.g., `flex-basis: `${leftPaneWidth}%`).

### 3.2. Inner Editors / Contained File Blocks (Future Cycle)

-   **Strategy:** This requires a significant change to how the response content is rendered. Instead of treating the response as a single block of text to be rendered as Markdown, it must be parsed into a structured array of objects.
-   **Parsing Logic (`view.tsx`):**
    -   A new parsing function will take the raw response string and split it into an array of segments, e.g., `[{ type: 'markdown', content: '...' }, { type: 'file', path: '...', content: '...' }, ...]`.
-   **Rendering Logic (`view.tsx`):**
    -   The main render function will map over this array of segments.
    -   If `segment.type === 'markdown'`, it renders the content as before.
    -   If `segment.type === 'file'`, it renders a new component, e.g., `FileBlock.tsx`.
-   **`FileBlock.tsx` Component:**
    -   This component will be responsible for rendering a single file from the AI response.
    -   It will have a header displaying the file path and the file-specific action buttons (Accept, Diff, etc.).
    -   The main content area will be a `div` with CSS properties `max-height: 300px;` (or similar) and `overflow-y: auto;`.
    -   The code content within this `div` will be syntax-highlighted as before.
