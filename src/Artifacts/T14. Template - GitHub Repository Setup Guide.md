## 1. Overview

This guide provides the necessary commands to turn your local project folder into a Git repository, link it to a new repository on GitHub, and outlines a sample workflow for using Git alongside the Data Curation Environment (DCE).

## 2. Prerequisites

*   You have `git` installed on your machine.
*   You have a GitHub account.

## 3. Step-by-Step Setup

### Step 1: Create a New Repository on GitHub

1.  Go to [github.com](https://github.com) and log in.
2.  In the top-right corner, click the `+` icon and select **"New repository"**.
3.  **Repository name:** Enter a name for your project (e.g., `my-new-project`).
4.  **Description:** (Optional) Provide a brief description of your project.
5.  Choose **"Private"** or **"Public"**.
6.  **IMPORTANT:** Do **not** initialize the repository with a `README`, `.gitignore`, or `license`. We will be pushing our existing files, and this will prevent conflicts.
7.  Click **"Create repository"**.

GitHub will now show you a page with command-line instructions. We will use the section titled **"...or push an existing repository from the command line"**.

### Step 2: Initialize Git in Your Local Project

Open a terminal and navigate to your project's root directory. Then, run the following commands one by one.

1.  **Initialize the repository:**
    ```bash
    git init
    ```

2.  **Add all existing files:**
    ```bash
    git add .
    ```

3.  **Create the first commit:**
    ```bash
    git commit -m "Initial commit"
    ```

4.  **Rename the default branch to `main`:**
    ```bash
    git branch -M main
    ```

### Step 3: Link and Push to GitHub

1.  **Add the remote repository:** Replace the placeholder URL with the one from your GitHub repository page.
    ```bash
    git remote add origin https://github.com/YOUR_USERNAME/YOUR_REPOSITORY.git
    ```

2.  **Push your local `main` branch to GitHub:**
    ```bash
    git push -u origin main
    ```

After these commands complete, refresh your GitHub repository page. You should see all of your project files.

## 4. Sample Development Workflow with DCE and Git

Git is a powerful tool for managing the iterative changes produced by the DCE. It allows you to quickly test an AI's proposed solution and revert it cleanly if it doesn't work, without losing your place.

### Step 1: Start with a Clean State
Before starting a new cycle, ensure your working directory is clean. You can check this with `git status`. All your previous changes should be committed.

### Step 2: Generate a Prompt and Get Responses
Use the DCE to generate a `prompt.md` file. Use this prompt to get multiple responses (e.g., 4 to 8) from your preferred AI model.

### Step 3: Paste and Parse
Paste the responses into the Parallel Co-Pilot Panel and click "Parse All".

### Step 4: Accept and Test
1.  Review the responses and find one that looks promising.
2.  Select that response and use the **"Accept Selected Files"** button to write the AI's proposed changes to your workspace.
3.  Now, compile and test the application. Does it work? Does it have errors?

### Step 5: The "Restore" Loop
This is where Git becomes a powerful part of the workflow.

*   **If the changes are bad (e.g., introduce bugs, don't work as expected):**
    1.  Open the terminal in VS Code.
    2.  Run the command: `git restore .`
    3.  This command instantly discards all uncommitted changes in your workspace, reverting your files to the state of your last commit.
    4.  You are now back to a clean state and can go back to the Parallel Co-Pilot Panel, select a *different* AI response, and click "Accept Selected Files" again to test the next proposed solution.

*   **If the changes are good:**
    1.  Open the Source Control panel in VS Code.
    2.  Stage the changes (`git add .`).
    3.  Write a commit message (e.g., "Feat: Implement user login via AI suggestion C15").
    4.  Commit the changes.
    5.  You are now ready to start the next development cycle from a new, clean state.

This iterative loop of `accept -> test -> restore` allows you to rapidly audition multiple AI-generated solutions without fear of corrupting your codebase.
