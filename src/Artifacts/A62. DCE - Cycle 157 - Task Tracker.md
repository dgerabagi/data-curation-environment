## 2. Task List

| ID | Task | Status (C157) | Notes |
|---|---|---|---|
| 1 | Fix `A52.2 ... not found` error during prompt generation. | **In Progress** | Critical blocker. Requires passing extension URI to services. |
| 2 | Improve Cycle 0 prompt to guide AI to "pick from" templates. | **In Progress** | Prompt engineering change in `prompt.service.ts`. |
| 3 | Verify that parser code (`A52.1`) is injected into prompts. | **To Do** | Review `prompt.service.ts` to ensure this is happening for C1+. |
| 4 | Fix "Sort by Tokens" to be a persistent toggle. | **In Progress** | Regression. Check state loading logic in `view.tsx`. |
| 5 | Enable `Ctrl+Z` (undo) in cycle context text fields. | **In Progress** | Check for `onKeyDown` handlers that block default behavior. |
| 6 | Fix bug where new associated files aren't auto-added. | **To Do** | Likely a state/timing issue in the file watcher/auto-add logic. |
