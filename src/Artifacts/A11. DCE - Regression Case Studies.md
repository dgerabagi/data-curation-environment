# Artifact A11: DCE - Regression Case Studies
# Date Created: C16
# Author: AI Model & Curator
# Updated on: C188 (Add case study for runtime syntax errors)

## 1. Purpose

This document serves as a living record of persistent or complex bugs that have recurred during development. By documenting the root cause analysis (RCA) and the confirmed solution for each issue, we create a "source of truth" that can be referenced to prevent the same mistakes from being reintroduced into the codebase.

**This artifact is the primary log for new and recent case studies.** Older, resolved issues are archived in `A11.1 DCE - New Regression Case Studies.md` to keep this document concise and focused on currently relevant issues.

### Case Study 025: Runtime vs. Build-time Syntax Errors

-   **Artifacts Affected:** `src/client/utils/response-parser.ts`
-   **Cycles Observed:** C188
-   **Symptom:** The Parallel Co-Pilot Panel appears as a completely blank white screen. No errors are visible in the extension host logs, but the webview fails to render any content.
-   **Root Cause Analysis (RCA):** The webview's JavaScript bundle contained a subtle but fatal syntax error that was not caught by the TypeScript/Babel build process. The code attempted to use an invalid form of optional chaining and nullish coalescing (`match?. ?? ''`) when trying to access properties of a regex match object. While the build completed successfully, the browser's JavaScript engine encountered this invalid syntax upon loading the script and immediately threw an `Uncaught SyntaxError`, halting all further execution and preventing React from rendering. The lack of build-time errors made this difficult to diagnose without inspecting the webview's own developer console.
-   **Codified Solution & Best Practice:**
    1.  **Correct Syntax:** The only way to access an element from an array-like object (such as a regex match) using optional chaining is with bracket notation: `match?.[1]`. The invalid `match?.` syntax must be corrected.
    2.  **Best Practice:** When debugging a "blank screen" webview with no backend errors, the first step is always to open the Webview Developer Tools (`Developer: Open Webview Developer Tools` from the Command Palette). This provides access to the client-side console, which will immediately reveal any runtime JavaScript errors that are preventing the application from loading.

### Case Study 024: PCPP Context/Title Data Loss on Tab Switch

-   **Artifacts Affected:** `src/client/views/parallel-copilot.view/view.tsx`
-   **Cycles Observed:** C185
-   **Symptom:** Text entered into the "Cycle Context," "Ephemeral Context," or "Cycle Title" fields is lost when the user switches to a different cycle or another VS Code tab and then returns. The data is not persisted to `dce_history.json`.
-   **Root Cause Analysis (RCA):** This is a critical data loss bug caused by a race condition between the application's debounced save mechanism and its state loading logic. The application waits for a pause in user input before saving changes to disk (debouncing) to improve performance. However, when the user performs an action that causes the view to reload its state (like switching cycles), the state is reloaded from the `dce_history.json` file *before* the debounced save has had a chance to execute. This overwrites the user's recent, unsaved changes with the older, stale data from the file.
-   **Codified Solution & Best Practice:**
    1.  **Trigger Save Before Navigation:** The event handler for any action that causes a state reload (e.g., `handleCycleChange`) **must** trigger an immediate, non-debounced save of the current component's state *before* dispatching the request to load the new state.
    2.  **Implementation:** The `saveCurrentCycleState` function should be callable directly. The `handleCycleChange` function must be modified to call `saveCurrentCycleState()` before it sends the `RequestCycleData` IPC message. This ensures the latest changes are always persisted before a potentially overwriting state load occurs, eliminating the race condition.
