# Artifact A11: DCE - Regression Case Studies
# Date Created: C16
# Author: AI Model & Curator
# Updated on: C25 (Add Auto-Add Race Condition case)

## 1. Purpose

This document serves as a living record of persistent or complex bugs that have recurred during development. By documenting the root cause analysis (RCA) and the confirmed solution for each issue, we create a "source of truth" that can be referenced to prevent the same mistakes from being reintroduced into the codebase.

**This artifact is the primary log for new and recent case studies.** Older, resolved issues are archived in `A11.1 DCE - New Regression Case Studies.md` to keep this document concise and focused on currently relevant issues.

## 2. Case Studies

### Case Study 033: Selection State Desynchronization Due to Auto-Add Race Condition

-   **Artifacts Affected:** `src/client/views/context-chooser.view/view.tsx`, `src/client/components/file-tree/FileTree.utils.ts`
-   **Cycles Observed:** C25
-   **Symptom:** When "Automatically add new files to selection" is enabled, a newly created file is added to the "Selected Items" list but cannot be removed by unchecking its checkbox. The UI state becomes desynchronized.
-   **Root Cause Analysis (RCA):** The bug is caused by a race condition on the frontend. The file watcher on the backend triggers two separate events almost simultaneously: a `ForceRefresh` message (for the file tree structure) and an `ApplySelectionSet` message (for the updated selection). The `ForceRefresh` handler was incorrectly designed to also request the latest selection state, creating two conflicting sources of truth for the selection. It was possible for the selection state (`checkedFiles`) to update from the `ApplySelectionSet` message before the file tree state (`files`) was updated from the `ForceRefresh`. If the user then clicked the checkbox, the state update logic would try to find the new file node in the old, stale file tree, fail to find it, and therefore fail to update the selection.
-   **Codified Solution & Best Practice:**
    1.  **Decouple Client-Side Refreshes:** The `ForceRefresh` message handler on the client must only be responsible for refreshing the data it's named for: the file tree. It should not also trigger a request for selection state. The selection state must only be updated when the client receives an explicit `ApplySelectionSet` message from the backend. This removes the race condition.
    2.  **Resilient State Utilities:** Client-side utilities that operate on state (like `addRemovePathInSelectedFiles`) should be defensively coded. In this case, if the utility is asked to remove a file path that exists in the selection set but cannot be found in the file tree (due to temporary staleness), it should still proceed to remove the path from the selection set to ensure the UI remains responsive to the user's intent.

### Case Study 032: Duplicate Files in Flattened Context Due to Path Normalization Issues

-   **Artifacts Affected:** `src/backend/services/flattener.service.ts`
-   **Cycles Observed:** C22, C23
-   **Symptom:** When the user's selection includes both a parent directory (e.g., `src`) and files within that directory, the final `flattened_repo.md` contains duplicate entries for those files.
-   **Root Cause Analysis (RCA):** The `expandDirectories` function recursively gathered all file paths. If the input was `['c:/proj/src', 'c:/proj/src/main.ts']`, the function would add `c:/proj/src/main.ts` once from the recursive scan and a second time from the explicit file path. A subsequent de-duplication step using `new Set()` was intended to prevent this, but it failed. The failure was due to inconsistent path separators on Windows. The recursive traversal might produce paths with forward slashes (`/`), while other parts of the system might use backslashes (`\`). The `Set` treated `'c:/proj/src/main.ts'` and `'c:\proj\src\main.ts'` as two unique strings, defeating the de-duplication.
-   **Codified Solution & Best Practice:** All file paths must be normalized to a consistent format *before* being used in collections or for comparison. A simple utility function that replaces all backslashes (`\`) with forward slashes (`/`) should be applied to every path string as soon as it is read or constructed. This ensures that path comparisons and `Set`-based de-duplication are always reliable, regardless of the operating system.

### Case Study 031: Duplicate Files in Context due to Incomplete Root Deselection

-   **Artifacts Affected:** `src/client/components/file-tree/FileTree.utils.ts`, `src/backend/services/flattener.service.ts`
-   **Cycles Observed:** C21
-   **Symptom:** When a user checks the root directory (selecting all files), then unchecks it, some files remain in the "Selected Items" list. If the user then re-checks the root directory, these leftover files are added again, resulting in duplicates in the `flattened_repo.md` file.
-   **Root Cause Analysis (RCA):** The bug has two layers. The primary cause is a flaw in the frontend state management logic in `FileTree.utils.ts`. The "uncheck" logic was not correctly removing all descendant files from the selection state when an ancestor checkbox was toggled off. This left a stale, incorrect selection state. The secondary issue is that the `flattener.service.ts` trusted its input implicitly and did not perform a final de-duplication pass before processing the files.
-   **Codified Solution & Best Practice:**
    1.  **Backend Safeguard:** The `flattener.service.ts` must be made resilient to faulty input. Before processing, the `flatten` method must de-duplicate the incoming array of file paths using `[...new Set(paths)]`. This provides a robust, final guarantee against duplicates in the output.
    2.  **Frontend Fix:** The selection logic in `FileTree.utils.ts` must be corrected. The `addRemovePathInSelectedFiles` function must ensure that when a node is unchecked, *all* of its descendant files are recursively found and removed from the selection set, ensuring perfect state synchronization.

### Case Study 030: Project Plan Data Loss on Tab Switch (Cycle 0)

-   **Artifacts Affected:** `src/client/views/parallel-copilot.view/view.tsx`
-   **Cycles Observed:** C20
-   **Symptom:** When in the "Cycle 0" onboarding view, any text typed into the "Project Scope" text area is lost if the user navigates to a different VS Code tab and then returns to the PCPP.
-   **Root Cause Analysis (RCA):** The `OnboardingView` component's `onScopeChange` prop was wired directly to the `setCycleContext` state setter in the parent `view.tsx` component. This updated the state but bypassed the `onCycleContextChange` handler function, which is responsible for also setting the `saveStatus` to `'unsaved'`. Without the `saveStatus` change, the debounced auto-save mechanism was never triggered, and the unsaved changes were lost when the webview's state was reloaded on tab focus.
-   **Codified Solution & Best Practice:** When a child component needs to update a parent's state, it should be passed the full handler function (e.g., `onCycleContextChange`) as a prop, not just the raw state setter. This ensures all related logic, such as triggering saves or updating derived state (like token counts), is executed correctly. The parent component should pass `onScopeChange={onCycleContextChange}` to the child.

### Case Study 029: Settings Panel Fails to Load Content in Extension Host

-   **Artifacts Affected:** `src/backend/services/file-operation.service.ts`
-   **Cycles Observed:** C18
-   **Symptom:** When running the extension in a debug host, the settings panel displays "README.md not found in workspace root." and "CHANGELOG.md not found in workspace root."
-   **Root Cause Analysis (RCA):** The `file-operation.service` was using `vscode.workspace.workspaceFolders.uri.fsPath` to construct the path to the README and CHANGELOG files. This path points to the root of the *user's currently open project*, not the extension's own installation directory. The asset files are bundled with the extension and are not present in the user's workspace.
-   **Codified Solution & Best Practice:** Backend services that need to read the extension's own bundled files must be initialized with or have access to the `vscode.ExtensionContext` object provided during activation. The correct, reliable path to bundled assets should be constructed using `context.extensionPath`. This ensures that the extension always looks inside its own directory for its own files, regardless of what workspace the user has open.

### Case Study 028: Incorrect Checkbox State for Non-Selectable Folders

-   **Artifacts Affected:** `src/backend/services/file-tree.service.ts`
-   **Cycles Observed:** C16
-   **Symptom:** Special, non-selectable folders like `.git`, `.vscode`, and `node_modules` appear with a normal, enabled checkbox instead of a grayed-out, disabled one. The checkbox is still not clickable, but the visual cue that it is non-selectable is missing.
-   **Root Cause Analysis (RCA):** The pattern matching logic in the `_isSelectable` method of `file-tree.service.ts` was not robust enough. Patterns like `'/.git/'` were being checked with `filePath.includes(pattern)`, which fails for root-level directories where the path is simply `c:/project/.git` and does not contain surrounding slashes.
-   **Codified Solution & Best Practice:** The pattern matching must account for different path structures. The solution is to check if the normalized path *includes* the pattern (for nested cases) OR if the `basename` of the path *is* the pattern name (for root-level cases). This ensures that directories like `.git` are correctly identified as non-selectable regardless of their position in the path string.

### Case Study 027: Dist Files Incorrectly Auto-Added to Selection

-   **Artifacts Affected:** `src/backend/services/file-tree.service.ts`
-   **Cycles Observed:** C14, C15
-   **Symptom:** When a build process creates new files inside an excluded directory like `dist/` or `apps/backend/dist/`, the "Automatically add new files to selection" feature incorrectly adds these new files to the selection set, even though the `dist` folder itself is correctly marked as non-selectable.
-   **Root Cause Analysis (RCA):** The logic for the `onDidCreate` file system watcher was incomplete. It was checking if the "auto-add" feature was enabled but was failing to also check if the newly created file's path matched any of the defined `NON_SELECTABLE_PATTERNS`. The initial pattern `'/dist/'` was also not robust enough as it only matched `dist` at the root.
-   **Codified Solution & Best Practice:**
    1.  The exclusion patterns must be robust. A pattern like `'**/dist/**'` should be used to match `dist` directories at any depth.
    2.  The `onDidCreate` handler in `file-tree.service.ts` must perform the same check that the UI rendering does. Before queuing a file for auto-addition, it must call the `_isSelectable(filePath, fileType)` helper method. If this method returns `false`, the file must be ignored. This ensures that the auto-add feature fully respects the project's exclusion rules.

### Case Study 026: "Command Already Exists" Activation Error

-   **Artifacts Affected:** `src/extension.ts`, `src/backend/commands/commands.ts`
-   **Cycles Observed:** C11
-   **Symptom:** The extension fails to activate with a critical error: `Error during activation: command 'dce.openSettingsPanel' already exists`.
-   **Root Cause Analysis (RCA):** The command ID `dce.openSettingsPanel` was being registered in two different places. It was registered once via the loop in `registerCommands` (which reads from the `commands.ts` array) and then registered a second time explicitly with `vscode.commands.registerCommand` in `extension.ts`. VS Code's command registry requires all command IDs to be unique, and this duplication caused a fatal activation error.
-   **Codified Solution & Best Practice:** The established pattern in the project is to use an internal command alias for commands that need access to the `ExtensionContext`.
    1.  The command defined in `commands.ts` (e.g., `dce.openSettingsPanel`) should be the "public" command triggered by the UI. Its callback should do nothing more than execute a different, "internal" command (e.g., `vscode.commands.executeCommand('dce.showSettingsPanel')`).
    2.  The "internal" command (e.g., `dce.showSettingsPanel`) is the one registered explicitly in `extension.ts`. This is where the logic that requires the `context` (like creating a webview panel) resides. This pattern ensures each command ID is registered only once, preventing conflicts.

### Case Study 025: Runtime vs. Build-time Syntax Errors

-   **Artifacts Affected:** `src/client/utils/response-parser.ts`
-   **Cycles Observed:** C188
-   **Symptom:** The Parallel Co-Pilot Panel appears as a completely blank white screen. No errors are visible in the extension host logs, but the webview fails to render any content.
-   **Root Cause Analysis (RCA):** The webview's JavaScript bundle contained a subtle but fatal syntax error that was not caught by the TypeScript/Babel build process. The code attempted to use an invalid form of optional chaining and nullish coalescing (`match?. ?? ''`) when trying to access properties of a regex match object. While the build completed successfully, the browser's JavaScript engine encountered this invalid syntax upon loading the script and immediately threw an `Uncaught SyntaxError`, halting all further execution and preventing React from rendering. The lack of build-time errors made this difficult to diagnose without inspecting the webview's own developer console.
-   **Codified Solution & Best Practice:**
    1.  **Correct Syntax:** The only way to access an element from an array-like object (such as a regex match) using optional chaining is with bracket notation: `match?.`. The invalid `match?.` syntax must be corrected.
    2.  **Best Practice:** When debugging a "blank screen" webview with no backend errors, the first step is always to open the Webview Developer Tools (`Developer: Open Webview Developer Tools` from the Command Palette). This provides access to the client-side console, which will immediately reveal any runtime JavaScript errors that are preventing the application from loading.

### Case Study 024: PCPP Context/Title Data Loss or Corruption on Navigation

-   **Artifacts Affected:** `src/client/views/parallel-copilot.view/view.tsx`, `src/backend/services/history.service.ts`
-   **Cycles Observed:** C185, C189, C190, C2, C3, C4, C5
-   **Symptom:** Text entered into the "Cycle Context," "Ephemeral Context," or "Cycle Title" fields is lost or, more critically, data from one cycle is saved over another. This occurs when the user performs an action that reloads the view's state from disk, such as creating a new cycle or switching to a different cycle, especially when done quickly.
-   **Root Cause Analysis (RCA):** This is a critical data integrity bug caused by a race condition between a debounced (delayed) auto-save and the state loading event. When the user navigates to a new cycle, the state is reloaded from `dce_history.json` *before* the debounced save for the departing cycle has executed. This causes the UI's current state (with the old cycle's data) to be saved over the newly loaded cycle's data, corrupting the history file.
-   **Codified Solution & Best Practice:** The definitive solution is to prevent the user from initiating the race condition by making the save state explicit in the UI.
    1.  **Stateful Save Status:** The UI must maintain a `saveStatus` state (`'unsaved'`, `'saving'`, `'saved'`). Any change to persisted data immediately sets the status to `'unsaved'`.
    2.  **Navigation Locking:** All UI controls that trigger a cycle change (e.g., "Next," "Previous," "New Cycle" buttons) **must** be disabled whenever the `saveStatus` is not `'saved'`.
    3.  **Asynchronous Save with Acknowledgement:** The debounced auto-save function, when it fires, must set the status to `'saving'`. The backend, upon successfully writing the data to disk, must send an explicit acknowledgement message back to the frontend.
    4.  **UI Unlock:** The frontend, upon receiving the save acknowledgement for the current cycle, sets the status to `'saved'`, which re-enables the navigation controls. This creates a clear, safe, and transparent workflow for the user, making data loss impossible.
