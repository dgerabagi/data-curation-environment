# Artifact A11: DCE - Regression Case Studies
# Date Created: C16
# Author: AI Model & Curator
# Updated on: C189 (Expand data loss case study for new cycle creation)

## 1. Purpose

This document serves as a living record of persistent or complex bugs that have recurred during development. By documenting the root cause analysis (RCA) and the confirmed solution for each issue, we create a "source of truth" that can be referenced to prevent the same mistakes from being reintroduced into the codebase.

**This artifact is the primary log for new and recent case studies.** Older, resolved issues are archived in `A11.1 DCE - New Regression Case Studies.md` to keep this document concise and focused on currently relevant issues.

### Case Study 025: Runtime vs. Build-time Syntax Errors

-   **Artifacts Affected:** `src/client/utils/response-parser.ts`
-   **Cycles Observed:** C188
-   **Symptom:** The Parallel Co-Pilot Panel appears as a completely blank white screen. No errors are visible in the extension host logs, but the webview fails to render any content.
-   **Root Cause Analysis (RCA):** The webview's JavaScript bundle contained a subtle but fatal syntax error that was not caught by the TypeScript/Babel build process. The code attempted to use an invalid form of optional chaining and nullish coalescing (`match?. ?? ''`) when trying to access properties of a regex match object. While the build completed successfully, the browser's JavaScript engine encountered this invalid syntax upon loading the script and immediately threw an `Uncaught SyntaxError`, halting all further execution and preventing React from rendering. The lack of build-time errors made this difficult to diagnose without inspecting the webview's own developer console.
-   **Codified Solution & Best Practice:**
    1.  **Correct Syntax:** The only way to access an element from an array-like object (such as a regex match) using optional chaining is with bracket notation: `match?.[1]`. The invalid `match?.` syntax must be corrected.
    2.  **Best Practice:** When debugging a "blank screen" webview with no backend errors, the first step is always to open the Webview Developer Tools (`Developer: Open Webview Developer Tools` from the Command Palette). This provides access to the client-side console, which will immediately reveal any runtime JavaScript errors that are preventing the application from loading.

### Case Study 024: PCPP Context/Title Data Loss on Tab Switch or Cycle Change

-   **Artifacts Affected:** `src/client/views/parallel-copilot.view/view.tsx`, `src/backend/services/history.service.ts`
-   **Cycles Observed:** C185, C189
-   **Symptom:** Text entered into the "Cycle Context," "Ephemeral Context," or "Cycle Title" fields is lost. This can also manifest as a newly created cycle disappearing entirely. The data loss occurs when the user performs an action that reloads the view's state from disk, such as switching to a different cycle, creating a new cycle, or switching to another VS Code tab and then returning. The data is not persisted to `dce_history.json` in time.
-   **Root Cause Analysis (RCA):** This is a critical data loss bug caused by a race condition between the application's debounced save mechanism and its state loading logic. The application waits for a pause in user input before saving changes to disk (debouncing) to improve performance. However, when the user performs an action that causes the view to reload its state (like switching cycles or tabbing away), the state is reloaded from `dce_history.json` *before* the debounced save has had a chance to execute. This overwrites the user's recent, unsaved changes with the older, stale data from the file. The same issue occurs when creating a new cycle: the new, empty cycle state is not saved immediately, so if the user tabs away, the state is lost and the UI reverts to the previous cycle.
-   **Codified Solution & Best Practice:**
    1.  **Trigger Save Before Navigation/State Change:** The event handler for any action that causes a state reload (e.g., `handleCycleChange`) **must** trigger an immediate, non-debounced save of the current component's state *before* dispatching the request to load the new state.
    2.  **Save on New Cycle Creation:** The `handleNewCycle` function **must** perform two synchronous saves: first, it saves the state of the cycle being departed. Second, after setting the state for the new, empty cycle, it **must** immediately construct the new cycle object and save it. This ensures the new cycle is persisted to disk before any other user action can occur.
    3.  **Save on Visibility Change:** A `visibilitychange` event listener must be added to the document. When the webview panel is hidden, an immediate save must be triggered. This handles cases like switching VS Code tabs.
    4.  **Implementation:** The `saveCurrentCycleState` function should be callable directly (non-debounced). The various event handlers must be modified to call this function at the appropriate times to eliminate the race condition entirely.
