# Artifact A11: DCE - Regression Case Studies
# Date Created: Cycle 16
# Author: AI Model & Curator
# Updated on: C16 (Add Case Study for Checkbox State Management)

- **Key/Value for A0:**
- **Description:** Documents recurring bugs, their root causes, and codified solutions to prevent future regressions during development.
- **Tags:** bugs, regression, troubleshooting, development, best practices

## 1. Purpose

This document serves as a living record of persistent or complex bugs that have recurred across multiple development cycles. By documenting the root cause analysis (RCA) and the confirmed solution for each issue, we create a "source of truth" that can be referenced to prevent the same mistakes from being reintroduced into the codebase.

## 2. Case Studies

### Case Study 002: Checkbox State Management in File Tree

-   **Artifacts Affected:** `src/client/components/file-tree/FileTree.utils.ts`, `src/client/components/file-tree/FileTree.tsx`
-   **Cycles Observed:** 14, 15, 16
-   **Symptom:** Checkbox functionality in the file tree is erratic. Only the root checkbox works as expected, but individual files or sub-folders cannot be checked or unchecked correctly. Clicking a checkbox on a child of an already-selected folder fails to deselect it.
-   **Root Cause Analysis (RCA):**
    The core issue was overly complex and flawed state management logic within the `addRemovePathInSelectedFiles` utility function. The logic attempted to handle the "unchecking a child of a selected parent" case by removing the parent and re-adding all of its other children (the "siblings"). This approach was brittle and failed to correctly calculate the new state, leading to a UI that did not update correctly. The complexity made the function difficult to debug and maintain.

-   **Codified Solution & Best Practice:**
    1.  **Simplify State Logic:** The state management logic was rewritten to be more direct and declarative, using a `Set` for efficient manipulation of selected paths.
    2.  **Handle Cases Explicitly:** The new function explicitly handles the three primary user actions:
        *   **CHECK:** When a node is checked, any of its descendants that are already in the selection are removed, and the node's own path is added. This ensures the most senior selected path is always the one stored in state.
        *   **UNCHECK (Direct):** When a node that is explicitly in the selection list is unchecked, its path and the paths of all its descendants are removed.
        *   **UNCHECK (Subtractive):** When a node is unchecked because its parent was checked, the parent is removed from the selection. Then, all of the parent's direct children *except for the one that was clicked* are added to the selection. This correctly "subtracts" the item from the parent's group selection without complex traversals.
    3.  **Robust Event Handling:** Ensure the checkbox `onChange` handler in the React component uses `event.stopPropagation()` to prevent the click event from bubbling up and triggering other actions, such as folder expansion.

-   **Example of Flawed Logic (Conceptual):**
    ```typescript
    // OLD LOGIC
    if (unchecking a child of a selected parent) {
      // 1. Remove parent from selected list.
      // 2. Traverse the entire tree from the parent.
      // 3. Add every descendant of the parent back, EXCEPT the clicked child.
      // This was inefficient and error-prone.
    }
    ```

-   **Example of Correct Logic (Conceptual):**
    ```typescript
    // NEW LOGIC
    if (unchecking a child of a selected parent) {
      // 1. Remove the parent from the selection set.
      const parentNode = findParentNode(clickedPath);
      // 2. Add all of the parent's *direct children* to the selection set,
      //    except for the clicked child itself.
      parentNode.children.forEach(child => {
        if (child.path !== clickedPath) {
          selectionSet.add(child.path);
        }
      });
    }
    ```

### Case Study 001: `path.sep` Usage in Frontend Components

-   **Artifacts Affected:** `src/client/components/file-tree/FileTree.tsx`
-   **Cycles Observed:** 13, 14, 16
-   **Symptom:** The webpack build process fails with TypeScript errors similar to `TS2339: Property 'sep' does not exist on type 'string'`.
-   **Root Cause Analysis (RCA):**
    The error occurs when frontend code (React components running in a webview) attempts to use `path.sep`. The `path` module is a core part of the Node.js runtime, but it does not exist in the browser-like context of a webview.
-   **Codified Solution & Best Practice:**
    1.  **Strict Environment Separation:** All file system path manipulation **must** occur in the backend (`src/backend/`).
    2.  **Normalized Paths:** The backend must normalize all paths to use forward slashes (`/`) before sending them to the frontend.
    3.  **Frontend Simplicity:** The frontend code must treat all file paths as simple strings and should never attempt to parse or join them using path-specific separators.
