## 1. Vision & Goal

Phase 2 of the Data Curation Environment aims to solve the "single-threaded" nature of interacting with AI assistants. The current workflow for developers often involves sending the same prompt to multiple models or conversations, copying the results to separate text files, and then manually integrating them into their project to test. This is inefficient and cumbersome.

The goal of the **Parallel Co-Pilot Panel** is to create an integrated, **persistent** environment within VS Code specifically for managing, comparing, diffing, and testing multiple AI-generated code responses.

**Core Workflow (C91 Update):** The primary interaction model is now **parse-centric** and **globally controlled**. The user pastes raw AI responses into simple text areas in each tab. A single, global "Parse All" button then processes the raw text in all tabs simultaneously, transforming their UIs into a structured, read-only view. This view separates the AI's plan from its code artifacts and includes a new "Associated Files" list for at-a-glance validation.

## 2. Core Concepts

1.  **Dedicated View Container:** The panel has its own icon in the Activity Bar, providing a distinct, full-height space for its UI.
2.  **Stateful & Persistent:** The content of all tabs, context fields, and the current cycle number are automatically saved. The state persists across sessions and when moving the panel to a new window.
3.  **Global Parse-on-Demand:** A single "Parse All Responses" button in the main header controls the view mode for all tabs.
4.  **Structured, Readable View:** After parsing, each tab's `textarea` is replaced by a static, read-only view that:
    *   Renders the AI's summary and plan as **formatted Markdown**.
    *   Uses **collapsible sections** for the main UI areas (Cycle Info, Summary, etc.) to manage screen real estate.
    *   Displays an **"Associated Files" list** with indicators (`✓`/`✗`) showing if the files exist in the workspace.
    *   Displays individual, **syntax-highlighted** code blocks for each file.
5.  **Live Testing via "Swap":** The core innovation is a "swap" feature. The user can, with a single click, exchange the content of a parsed file block with its corresponding source file in the workspace.
6.  **Integrated Diffing:** Users can click on a file in the "Associated Files" list to see an immediate diff view comparing the AI's suggestion against the current workspace file.
7.  **Cycle Navigator:** A UI to navigate back and forth through the history of development cycles, loading the corresponding AI responses for each cycle.
8.  **Metadata Display:** Each response tab will display key metadata, such as token counts and similarity scores, to help the user quickly evaluate the AI's output.

## 3. User Stories

| ID | User Story | Acceptance Criteria |
|---|---|---|
| P2-US-01 | **Manage Multiple Responses** | As a developer, I want a dedicated panel with multiple tabs where I can place different AI-generated code responses, so I can keep them organized. | - A new icon in the Activity Bar opens the Parallel Co-Pilot panel. <br> - The panel contains a slider or input to select the number of visible tabs. <br> - Each tab initially contains a large text input area. |
| P2-US-02 | **Parse All Responses** | As a developer, after pasting responses into multiple tabs, I want to click a single button to parse all of them into a structured view, so I can easily review them without repetitive clicking. | - A global "Parse All Responses" button exists in the panel's header. <br> - Clicking it processes the raw text in every tab. <br> - Each tab's UI transforms to show distinct sections for summary, action plan, and file blocks. <br> - A corresponding "Un-Parse All" button reverts all tabs to their raw text view. |
| P2-US-03 | **View Formatted Text** | As a developer, I want the AI's summary and plan to be rendered as formatted Markdown, so I can easily read lists, bolded text, and other formatting. | - The summary and course of action sections correctly render Markdown syntax. |
| P2-US-04 | **Manage UI Space** | As a developer, I want to be able to collapse the main sections of the UI, so I can focus on the code blocks without excessive scrolling. | - The Cycle Info, Summary, Course of Action, and Associated Files sections have collapsible headers. |
| P2-US-05 | **Verify Response Validity** | As a developer, I want to see a list of all files an AI response intends to modify, with a clear indicator of whether those files exist in my project, so I can immediately spot hallucinations or new file suggestions. | - After parsing, a list of "Associated Files" is displayed. <br> - A checkmark (`✓`) appears next to files that exist in the workspace. <br> - An 'x' (`✗`) appears next to files that do not exist. |
| P2-US-06 | **Persistent State** | As a developer, I want all the text I've entered into the panel to be saved automatically, so I don't lose my work if I close the panel, move it, or restart VS Code. | - All raw text content is saved to a history file (`.vscode/dce_history.json`). <br> - When the panel is reopened, it loads the state from the most recent cycle. |
| P2-US-07 | **Review Changes with Diff** | As a developer, I want to click on any file in the "Associated Files" list to see a diff, so I can review the exact changes before testing. | - Clicking a file path in the list opens a diff view comparing the workspace version with the AI's version. |
| P2-US-08 | **Navigate Cycle History** | As a developer, I want to navigate backward and forward through my project's development cycles, so I can review past AI suggestions. | - UI controls exist to move between cycles. <br> - Navigating to a past cycle loads its saved raw responses into the panel. |
