# Artifact A12: DCE - Logging and Debugging Guide

- **Key/Value for A0:**
- **Description:** Explains how to access and use the integrated logging solution for debugging the extension's backend and frontend components.
- **Tags:** logging, debugging, troubleshooting, development, output channel

## 1. Purpose

This document provides instructions on how to access and use the logging features built into the Data Curation Environment (DCE) extension. Effective logging is crucial for diagnosing performance issues, tracking down bugs, and understanding the extension's behavior during development.

## 2. Two Primary Log Locations

There are two separate places to look for logs, depending on where the code is running.

### Location 1: The "Debug Console" (For `console.log`)

This is where you find logs from the **backend** (the extension's main Node.js process).

-   **What you'll see here:** `console.log()` statements from files in `src/backend/` and `src/extension.ts`. This is useful for debugging the extension's core activation and services *before* the UI is even visible.
-   **Where to find it:** In your **main development window** (the one where you press `F5`), look in the bottom panel for the **"DEBUG CONSOLE"** tab.

    ```
    -----------------------------------------------------------------------------------
    | PROBLEMS    OUTPUT    DEBUG CONSOLE    TERMINAL                                 |
    |---------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
    |                                                                                 |
    |  > Congratulations, your extension "Data Curation Environment" is now active!   |
    |  > FSService watcher initialized.                                               |
    |  ...                                                                            |
    -----------------------------------------------------------------------------------
    ```

### Location 2: The "Output" Channel (For Centralized Logging)

This is the primary, centralized log for the entire extension, including messages from the **frontend (WebView)**.

-   **What you'll see here:** Formatted log messages from both the backend (`LoggerService`) and the frontend (`logger.ts`). All messages are prefixed with a level (`[INFO]`, `[WARN]`, `[ERROR]`) and a timestamp. Frontend messages are also prefixed with `[WebView]`.
-   **Where to find it:** In the **"[Extension Development Host]" window** (the new window that opens after you press `F5`), follow these steps:
    1.  **Open the Panel:** Press `Ctrl+J` (or `Cmd+J` on Mac).
    2.  **Navigate to the "OUTPUT" Tab.**
    3.  In the dropdown menu on the right, select **`Data Curation Environment`**.

    ```
    -----------------------------------------------------------------------------------
    | PROBLEMS    OUTPUT    DEBUG CONSOLE    TERMINAL                                 |
    |---------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
    |                                                 [Data Curation Environment v]   |
    |                                                                                 |
    |  [INFO] [2:30:00 PM] Services initialized.                                      |
    |  [INFO] [2:30:01 PM] Received request for workspace files.                      |
    |  [INFO] [2:30:01 PM] [WebView] Initializing view and requesting workspace files.|
    |  [INFO] [2:30:01 PM] Scanning for files with exclusion pattern: ...             |
    |  ...                                                                            |
    -----------------------------------------------------------------------------------
    ```

## 3. What is Logged?

*   **Backend Initialization:** Messages indicating that services are starting.
*   **File System Scans & Refreshes:**
    *   Confirmation when a file scan begins, including the exclusion pattern used.
    *   Confirmation when a file change is detected by the watcher.
    *   Confirmation when a refresh is triggered.
*   **Errors:** Any caught exceptions on both the backend and frontend are logged with an `[ERROR]` prefix.
*   **Frontend Actions:** Key user interactions in the UI (button clicks, etc.) are logged with a `[WebView]` prefix.
