# Artifact A12: DCE - Logging and Debugging Guide
# Date Created: Cycle 19
# Author: AI Model & Curator
# Updated on: C126 (Add section on truncated logging)

- **Key/Value for A0:**
- **Description:** Explains how to access and use the integrated logging solution for debugging the extension's backend and frontend components.
- **Tags:** logging, debugging, troubleshooting, development, output channel

## 1. Purpose

This document provides instructions on how to access and use the logging features built into the Data Curation Environment (DCE) extension. Effective logging is crucial for diagnosing performance issues, tracking down bugs, and understanding the extension's behavior during development.

## 2. Two Primary Log Locations

There are two separate places to look for logs, depending on where the code is running.

### Location 1: The "Debug Console" (For `console.log`)

This is where you find logs from the **backend** (the extension's main Node.js process).

-   **What you'll see here:** `console.log()` statements from files in `src/backend/` and `src/extension.ts`. This is useful for debugging the extension's core activation and services *before* the UI is even visible.
-   **Where to find it:** In your **main development window** (the one where you press `F5`), look in the bottom panel for the **"DEBUG CONSOLE"** tab.

    ```
    -----------------------------------------------------------------------------------
    | PROBLEMS    OUTPUT    DEBUG CONSOLE    TERMINAL                                 |
    |---------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
    |                                                                                 |
    |  > Congratulations, your extension "Data Curation Environment" is now active!   |
    |  > FSService watcher initialized.                                               |
    |  ...                                                                            |
    -----------------------------------------------------------------------------------
    ```

### Location 2: The "Output" Channel (For Centralized Logging)

This is the primary, centralized log for the entire extension, including messages from the **frontend (WebView)**.

-   **What you'll see here:** Formatted log messages from both the backend (`LoggerService`) and the frontend (`logger.ts`). All messages are prefixed with a level (`[INFO]`, `[WARN]`, `[ERROR]`) and a timestamp. Frontend messages are also prefixed with `[WebView]`.
-   **Where to find it:** In the **"[Extension Development Host]" window** (the new window that opens after you press `F5`), follow these steps:
    1.  **Open the Panel:** Press `Ctrl+J` (or `Cmd+J` on Mac).
    2.  **Navigate to the "OUTPUT" Tab.**
    3.  In the dropdown menu on the right, select **`Data Curation Environment`**.

    ```
    -----------------------------------------------------------------------------------
    | PROBLEMS    OUTPUT    DEBUG CONSOLE    TERMINAL                                 |
    |---------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
    |                                                 [Data Curation Environment v]   |
    |                                                                                 |
    |  [INFO] [2:30:00 PM] Services initialized.                                      |
    |  [INFO] [2:30:01 PM] Received request for workspace files.                      |
    |  [INFO] [2:30:01 PM] [WebView] Initializing view and requesting workspace files.|
    |  [INFO] [2:30:01 PM] Scanning for files with exclusion pattern: ...             |
    |  ...                                                                            |
    -----------------------------------------------------------------------------------
    ```

## 3. Tactical Debugging with Logs (C93)

When a feature is not working as expected, especially one that involves communication between the frontend and backend, the most effective debugging technique is to add **tactical logs** at every step of the data's journey.

### Case Study: Fixing the "Associated Files" Parser (Cycle 93)

-   **Problem:** The UI was incorrectly reporting that files from a parsed AI response did not exist in the workspace.
-   **Data Flow:**
    1.  **Frontend (`view.tsx`):** User clicks "Parse All".
    2.  **Frontend (`response-parser.ts`):** Raw text is parsed into a list of relative file paths (e.g., `src/main.ts`).
    3.  **IPC (`RequestFileExistence`):** The list of relative paths is sent to the backend.
    4.  **Backend (`fs.service.ts`):** The backend receives the list and compares it against its own list of known workspace files, which are stored as absolute paths (e.g., `c:/project/src/main.ts`). The comparison fails.

## 4. Truncated Logging for Large Content (C126)

To prevent the output channel from becoming overwhelmed with large blocks of text (e.g., entire file contents), a logging utility has been implemented to truncate long strings.

-   **Behavior:** When a service logs a large piece of content (like a code block for syntax highlighting), it will use the `truncateStringForLogging` utility.
-   **Format:** If a string is longer than a set threshold (e.g., 100 characters), it will be displayed in the logs in a format like this:
    `[First 50 characters]...[Last 50 characters]`
-   **Benefit:** This keeps the logs clean and readable, allowing you to see that a large piece of data was processed without having its entire content flood the output. You can still see the beginning and end of the content to verify its identity.
