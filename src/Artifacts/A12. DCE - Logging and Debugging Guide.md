- **Key/Value for A0:**
- **Description:** Explains how to access and use the integrated logging solution for debugging the extension's backend and frontend components.
- **Tags:** logging, debugging, troubleshooting, development, output channel

## 1. Purpose

This document provides instructions on how to access and use the logging features built into the Data Curation Environment (DCE) extension. Effective logging is crucial for diagnosing performance issues, tracking down bugs, and understanding the extension's behavior during development.

## 2. The Output Channel

The DCE extension centralizes all its logs—from both the backend (Node.js) and the frontend (React webview)—into a dedicated **Output Channel** within VS Code.

### How to Access the Logs

1.  **Open the Output Panel:** Use the command palette (`Ctrl+Shift+P` or `Cmd+Shift+P`) and search for **`View: Toggle Output`**, or use the shortcut `Ctrl+Shift+U`.

2.  **Select the DCE Channel:** In the top-right corner of the Output panel, there is a dropdown menu. Click it and select **`Data Curation Environment`** from the list.

3.  **View Logs:** The panel will now display all log messages generated by the extension. New messages will appear in real-time as you interact with the extension.

## 3. What is Logged?

The logging service is designed to provide insight into key operations:

*   **Backend Initialization:** Messages indicating that services are starting.
*   **File System Scans:**
    *   A log message appears when the `FSService` begins scanning the workspace.
    *   A confirmation message appears when the scan is complete, including the number of files found. This is useful for diagnosing performance issues related to file discovery (e.g., confirming that `node_modules` is being ignored).
*   **Flattening Process:** Logs are generated when the "Flatten Context" process starts and when it completes successfully.
*   **Errors:** Any caught exceptions or errors on both the backend and frontend are logged with an `[ERROR]` prefix, making them easy to spot.
*   **Frontend Actions:** Key user interactions in the UI can be logged to trace application flow.

## 4. Technical Implementation

*   **Backend (`logger.service.ts`):** A backend service creates and manages the `vscode.OutputChannel`. It exposes simple methods like `log()`, `warn()`, and `error()`.
*   **Frontend (`logger.ts`):** A lightweight utility on the client-side provides the same `log()`, `warn()`, and `error()` methods.
*   **IPC Bridge:** When a log function is called in the frontend, it sends an IPC message (`ClientToServerChannel.LogMessage`) to the backend. The backend's message handler then forwards this message to the `LoggerService`, which writes it to the central Output Channel. This ensures all logs are collected in one place.
