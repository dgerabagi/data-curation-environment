## 1. Purpose

This document provides instructions on how to access and use the logging features built into the Data Curation Environment (DCE) extension. Effective logging is crucial for diagnosing performance issues, tracking down bugs, and understanding the extension's behavior during development.

## 2. The Output Channel

The DCE extension centralizes all its logs—from both the backend (Node.js) and the frontend (React webview)—into a dedicated **Output Channel** within VS Code. This is the primary place to look for debugging information.

### How to Access the Logs

1.  **Open the Panel:** At the bottom of your VS Code window, ensure the panel is visible. You can toggle it with the command **`View: Toggle Panel`** (`Ctrl+J` or `Cmd+J`).

2.  **Navigate to the "OUTPUT" Tab:** In the panel's toolbar, click on the **"OUTPUT"** tab. It is usually grouped with "PROBLEMS", "DEBUG CONSOLE", and "TERMINAL".

3.  **Select the DCE Channel:** In the top-right corner of the Output panel, there is a dropdown menu that shows the currently active channel (it might default to "Tasks" or "Git"). Click this dropdown and select **`Data Curation Environment`** from the list.

    *If you followed these steps correctly, you will see a view similar to this:*
    ```
    -----------------------------------------------------------------------------------
    | PROBLEMS    OUTPUT    DEBUG CONSOLE    TERMINAL                                 |
    |---------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
    |                                                 [Tasks v] [Clear Output Icon]   |
    |                                                                                 |
    |  [INFO] [2:30:00 PM] Services initialized.                                      |
    |  [INFO] [2:30:01 PM] Received request for workspace files.                      |
    |  [INFO] [2:30:01 PM] Scanning for files with exclusion pattern: ...             |
    |  ...                                                                            |
    -----------------------------------------------------------------------------------
    ```

4.  **View Logs:** The panel will now display all log messages generated by the extension. New messages will appear in real-time as you interact with the extension.

## 3. What is Logged?

The logging service is designed to provide insight into key operations:

*   **Backend Initialization:** Messages indicating that services are starting.
*   **File System Scans:**
    *   A log message appears when the `FSService` begins scanning the workspace, including the exact exclusion pattern being used.
    *   A confirmation message appears when the scan is complete, including the number of files found. This is useful for diagnosing performance issues related to file discovery (e.g., confirming that `node_modules` is being ignored).
    *   Warnings for any large files that are skipped during token calculation.
*   **Flattening Process:** Logs are generated when the "Flatten Context" process starts and when it completes successfully.
*   **Errors:** Any caught exceptions or errors on both the backend and frontend are logged with an `[ERROR]` prefix, making them easy to spot.
*   **Frontend Actions:** Key user interactions in the UI (button clicks, etc.) are logged with a `[WebView]` prefix to trace application flow.
