# Artifact A88: DCE - Native Diff Integration Plan
# Date Created: C22
# Author: AI Model & Curator

- **Key/Value for A0:**
- **Description:** A plan to integrate VS Code's native diff viewer (`vscode.diff`) for comparing AI-generated file content against the current workspace file, leveraging a TextDocumentContentProvider for in-memory content.
- **Tags:** feature plan, ui, ux, diff, vscode api, virtual document

## 1. Overview & Goal

The current integrated diff viewer is functional but lacks the native feel, performance, and rich features of VS Code's own diffing engine (e.g., syntax highlighting, minimap, inline actions). The goal of this feature is to replace our custom `DiffViewer` component with a button that triggers the built-in `vscode.diff` command.

This provides a superior user experience and reduces the maintenance burden of our custom component. The primary technical challenge is that the AI-generated content exists only in the frontend's state (in-memory) and not as a file on disk. The solution is to create a **Virtual Document** using a `TextDocumentContentProvider`.

## 2. User Story

| ID | User Story | Acceptance Criteria |
|---|---|---|
| P2-DIFF-NATIVE-01 | **View Diff Natively** | As a developer, when I hover over an associated file in the PCPP, I want to click an "Open Changes" button that opens the diff in a native VS Code diff tab, so I can use all the familiar features of the editor to review the changes. | - An "Open Changes" icon appears on hover for each existing file in the "Associated Files" list. <br> - Clicking it executes the `vscode.diff` command. <br> - A new editor tab opens, showing a side-by-side diff. <br> - The right side shows the current content of the workspace file. <br> - The left side shows the AI-generated content from the response tab. |

## 3. Technical Implementation Plan

This implementation involves creating a new backend provider and coordinating state between the frontend and backend.

### Step 1: Create a TextDocumentContentProvider
-   **New File (`src/backend/providers/ResponseContentProvider.ts`):** A new class will be created that implements `vscode.TextDocumentContentProvider`.
-   **State Cache:** This provider will need a simple in-memory cache (e.g., a `Map<string, string>`) to store the AI-generated content. The key will be a unique identifier (like the URI itself), and the value will be the file content string.
-   **`provideTextDocumentContent` method:** This is the core method. When VS Code needs to open a virtual document (e.g., `dce-response:path/to/file.ts?cycle=22&resp=1`), this method will be called with the URI. It will look up the content in its cache using the URI as the key and return it.

### Step 2: Register the Provider and Command
-   **`extension.ts`:** In the `activate` function, the new provider will be registered with a custom URI scheme: `vscode.workspace.registerTextDocumentContentProvider('dce-response', responseContentProvider);`.

### Step 3: Implement the Frontend-to-Backend Workflow
-   **UI (`ParsedView.tsx`):** An "Open Changes" button will be added to each associated file item, visible on hover.
-   **IPC Channel (`RequestNativeDiff`):** A new IPC channel will be created. Its payload will be `{ originalPath: string; modifiedContent: string; }`.
-   **Backend Handler (`file-operation.service.ts`):**
    1.  A new `handleNativeDiffRequest` method will be implemented.
    2.  When it receives a request, it will generate a unique URI for the virtual document, incorporating the file path and potentially cycle/response IDs to ensure uniqueness (e.g., `dce-response:${originalPath}?cycle=${cycleId}&resp=${respId}`).
    3.  It will store the `modifiedContent` in the `ResponseContentProvider`'s cache, keyed by this unique URI.
    4.  It will then execute the command: `vscode.commands.executeCommand('vscode.diff', vscode.Uri.file(originalAbsolutePath), vscode.Uri.parse(virtualUri), 'Original ↔ AI Response');`.

This sequence allows us to show a native diff between a real file on disk and a string that only exists in our extension's memory, providing a seamless and powerful user experience.
