# Artifact A49: DCE - Phase 2 - File Association & Diffing Plan
# Date Created: C82
# Author: AI Model
# Updated on: C27 (Deprecate custom diff viewer in favor of native integration)

- **Key/Value for A0:**
- **Description:** Plans the UI and backend logic to visually link file blocks in an AI response to workspace files and sets the stage for an integrated diff tool.
- **Tags:** feature plan, phase 2, ui, ux, diff, file association

## 1. Overview & Goal

To make the Parallel Co-Pilot Panel's workflow trustworthy and intuitive, users need a clear visual confirmation of which local file an AI-generated code block is intended to modify. This feature introduces a "file association" mechanism that parses AI responses, verifies the existence of the mentioned files, and displays this status to the user.

**Update (C27):** The custom, integrated diff viewer has been **deprecated**. It is being replaced by an integration with VS Code's native diff viewer (`vscode.diff`), as detailed in `A88. DCE - Native Diff Integration Plan.md`. This provides a superior user experience with all the features of the native editor.

## 2. User Stories

| ID | User Story | Acceptance Criteria |
|---|---|---|
| P2-ASSOC-01 | **See Affected Files** | As a developer, when I parse an AI response, I want the extension to automatically show me a list of all the file paths it intends to modify, so I can understand the scope of the proposed changes. | - After parsing, a collapsible "Associated Files" section appears in the tab's UI. <br> - This section displays a list of all file paths found in the response. |
| P2-ASSOC-02 | **Verify File Existence** | As a developer, for each file listed, I want to see a visual indicator of whether that file already exists in my workspace, so I can spot potential errors or new files proposed by the AI. | - Next to each listed file path, an icon is displayed. <br> - A green checkmark (`✓`) indicates the file exists at that path. <br> - A red cross (`✗`) indicates the file does not exist. |
| P2-ASSOC-03 | **Preview Changes with Native Diff** | As a developer, I want an "Open Changes" button to see a side-by-side comparison of the original file and the AI's proposed changes in a native VS Code diff tab, so I can review the exact changes before accepting them. | - An "Open Changes" icon appears on hover for each existing file in the "Associated Files" list. <br> - Clicking it opens a new editor tab showing the native VS Code diff view. <br> - The right side shows the current content of the workspace file. <br> - The left side shows the AI-generated content from the response tab. |
| P2-ASSOC-04 | **Accept Changes** | As a developer, I want to be able to accept changes from the AI response into my workspace, either for a single file or for a batch of selected files. | - An "Accept this file" button replaces the content of the workspace file with the AI's version. <br> - A separate "Accept Selected Files" button performs a bulk replacement for all files checked in the "Associated Files" list. <br> - This is a one-way copy from the AI response to the workspace. |

## 3. Technical Implementation Plan

1.  **Frontend - Parsing (`response-parser.ts`):**
    *   **Status:** **Complete.**

2.  **Backend - Verification & Highlighting (`file-operation.service.ts`, `highlighting.service.ts`):**
    *   **Status:** **Complete.** The `handleFileExistenceRequest` and `handleSyntaxHighlightRequest` handlers are working.

3.  **Frontend - UI & State (`view.tsx`):**
    *   **Status:** **In Progress.**
    *   **File List & Native Diff:** Implement the "Associated Files" list. An "Open Changes" button on each item will trigger the new native diff workflow as outlined in `A88`.
    *   **Selection State:** Manage a `Set<string>` of `selectedFilesForReplacement` to track which files are checked.
    *   **Accept/Replace Logic:**
        *   The "Accept this file" button will trigger a `RequestWriteFile` IPC message.
        *   The "Accept Selected Files" button will trigger a `RequestBatchFileWrite` IPC message with an array of file paths and their new content.

4.  **Backend - File Writing (`file-operation.service.ts`):**
    *   **Status:** **Complete.** `handleWriteFileRequest` and `handleBatchFileWrite` are implemented.
