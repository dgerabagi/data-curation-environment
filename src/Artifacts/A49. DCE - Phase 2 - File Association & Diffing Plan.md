# Artifact A49: DCE - Phase 2 - File Association & Diffing Plan
# Date Created: C82
# Author: AI Model
# Updated on: C100 (Add diagnostic button and hover logging to plan)

- **Key/Value for A0:**
- **Description:** Plans the UI and backend logic to visually link file blocks in an AI response to workspace files and sets the stage for an integrated diff tool.
- **Tags:** feature plan, phase 2, ui, ux, diff, file association

## 1. Overview & Goal

To make the "Swap with Source" feature trustworthy and intuitive, users need a clear visual confirmation of which local file an AI-generated code block is intended to replace. This feature introduces a "file association" mechanism that parses AI responses, verifies the existence of the mentioned files, and displays this status to the user.

**Update (C95):** This plan is now evolved. The "Associated Files" list is not just for verification but is the primary interaction point for viewing changes. Clicking a file in this list now drives the UI, displaying a diff view in an adjacent panel.

## 2. User Stories

| ID | User Story | Acceptance Criteria |
|---|---|---|
| P2-ASSOC-01 | **See Affected Files** | As a developer, when I parse an AI response, I want the extension to automatically show me a list of all the file paths it intends to modify, so I can understand the scope of the proposed changes. | - After parsing, a collapsible "Associated Files" section appears in the tab's UI. <br> - This section displays a list of all file paths found in the response. |
| P2-ASSOC-02 | **Verify File Existence** | As a developer, for each file listed, I want to see a visual indicator of whether that file already exists in my workspace, so I can spot potential errors or new files proposed by the AI. | - Next to each listed file path, an icon is displayed. <br> - A green checkmark (`✓`) indicates the file exists at that path. <br> - A red cross (`✗`) indicates the file does not exist, alerting me to a potential hallucination or a new file creation. |
| P2-ASSOC-03 | **Preview Changes with Diff** | As a developer, I want to click on an existing file in the "Associated Files" list to immediately see a side-by-side comparison of the original file and the AI's proposed changes, so I can review the changes before swapping. | - Clicking a file with a `✓` in the list opens a diff view in a new panel to the right. <br> - The diff view clearly shows added, removed, and common lines. <br> - The diff view is the primary way to inspect changes. |

## 3. Technical Implementation Plan (C100)

1.  **Frontend - Parsing (`response-parser.ts`):**
    *   **Status:** **Complete.**

2.  **Backend - Verification & Content Fetching (`fs.service.ts`):**
    *   **Status:** **Complete.**

3.  **Frontend - UI & State (`view.tsx`):**
    *   **Status:** **CRITICAL BUG.** The diff view does not appear on click. No logs are generated, indicating a fundamental event handling failure.
    *   **Debugging Plan (C100 - Escalated):**
        *   **Step 1 (Isolate the data pipeline):** Add a temporary, standalone "Test First Diff" button to the UI. This button's `onClick` will bypass the list's event handlers and call the `handleSelectForDiff` function directly. If this works, the problem is confirmed to be with the list's event capture. If it fails, the problem is in the data flow or backend.
        *   **Step 2 (Diagnose Event Blocking):** Add `onMouseEnter` and `onMouseLeave` event handlers to every `<li>` in the "Associated Files" list. These handlers must log to the console. If hover events fire but click events do not, it proves the click is being blocked by a style (`pointer-events`) or an invisible overlay element with a higher `z-index`.
        *   **Step 3 (Confirm Auto-Diff Logic):** Add logging inside the `useEffect` hook that is supposed to auto-select the first valid file for diffing. The logs will confirm if the effect is running and if it finds a valid file, which helps verify the state is updating correctly.
        *   **Step 4 (Backend Logging):** Add a log statement at the very beginning of the `RequestFileContent` handler in `on-message.ts` to confirm if an IPC message is ever successfully dispatched from the client.
