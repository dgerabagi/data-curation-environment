# Artifact A49: DCE - Phase 2 - File Association & Diffing Plan
# Date Created: C82
# Author: AI Model
# Updated on: C96 (Add logging for debugging non-functional diff view)

- **Key/Value for A0:**
- **Description:** Plans the UI and backend logic to visually link file blocks in an AI response to workspace files and sets the stage for an integrated diff tool.
- **Tags:** feature plan, phase 2, ui, ux, diff, file association

## 1. Overview & Goal

To make the "Swap with Source" feature trustworthy and intuitive, users need a clear visual confirmation of which local file an AI-generated code block is intended to replace. This feature introduces a "file association" mechanism that parses AI responses, verifies the existence of the mentioned files, and displays this status to the user.

**Update (C95):** This plan is now evolved. The "Associated Files" list is not just for verification but is the primary interaction point for viewing changes. Clicking a file in this list now drives the UI, displaying a diff view in an adjacent panel.

## 2. User Stories

| ID | User Story | Acceptance Criteria |
|---|---|---|
| P2-ASSOC-01 | **See Affected Files** | As a developer, when I parse an AI response, I want the extension to automatically show me a list of all the file paths it intends to modify, so I can understand the scope of the proposed changes. | - After parsing, a collapsible "Associated Files" section appears in the tab's UI. <br> - This section displays a list of all file paths found in the response. |
| P2-ASSOC-02 | **Verify File Existence** | As a developer, for each file listed, I want to see a visual indicator of whether that file already exists in my workspace, so I can spot potential errors or new files proposed by the AI. | - Next to each listed file path, an icon is displayed. <br> - A green checkmark (`✓`) indicates the file exists at that path. <br> - A red cross (`✗`) indicates the file does not exist, alerting me to a potential hallucination or a new file creation. |
| P2-ASSOC-03 | **Preview Changes with Diff** | As a developer, I want to click on an existing file in the "Associated Files" list to immediately see a side-by-side comparison of the original file and the AI's proposed changes, so I can review the changes before swapping. | - Clicking a file with a `✓` in the list opens a diff view in a new panel to the right. <br> - The diff view clearly shows added, removed, and common lines. <br> - The diff view is the primary way to inspect changes. |

## 3. Technical Implementation Plan (C96)

1.  **Frontend - Parsing (`response-parser.ts`):**
    *   **Status:** **Complete.** The parser has been enhanced to check for angle-bracket paths first.

2.  **Backend - Verification & Content Fetching (`fs.service.ts`):**
    *   **Status:** **Complete.** The `handleFileExistenceRequest` and `handleFileContentRequest` handlers are implemented.

3.  **Frontend - UI & State (`view.tsx`):**
    *   **Status:** **Debugging.** The diff view is not appearing on click.
    *   **Workflow:**
        1.  User clicks a file in the list.
        2.  The `onClick` handler calls a function, `handleSelectForDiff`.
        3.  `handleSelectForDiff` sets the `diffTarget` state and sends a `RequestFileContent` IPC message.
        4.  The `onmessage` handler for `SendFileContent` receives the original file's text and sets the `originalFileContent` state.
        5.  The `DiffViewer` component renders when `diffTarget` and `originalFileContent` are both non-null.
    *   **Debugging Plan (C96):**
        *   **Step 1:** Add `logger.log()` inside the `onClick` handler in the `AssociatedFilesList` to confirm the click event is firing and `handleSelectForDiff` is being called with the correct `ParsedFile` object.
        *   **Step 2:** Add `logger.log()` just before the `clientIpc.sendToServer` call for `RequestFileContent` to confirm the IPC message is being sent.
        *   **Step 3:** Add `logger.log()` at the very beginning of the `onmessage` handler for `SendFileContent` to confirm the frontend is receiving the response from the backend.
        *   **Step 4:** Add `console.log()` statements inside the main `App` component's render body to inspect the values of `diffTarget` and `originalFileContent` on every re-render. This will reveal if the state is being set correctly but failing to trigger the render, or if the state is not being set at all.
