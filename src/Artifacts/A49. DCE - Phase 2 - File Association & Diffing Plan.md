# Artifact A49: DCE - Phase 2 - File Association & Diffing Plan
# Date Created: C82
# Author: AI Model
# Updated on: C95 (Update UI flow to a two-pane diff view)

- **Key/Value for A0:**
- **Description:** Plans the UI and backend logic to visually link file blocks in an AI response to workspace files and sets the stage for an integrated diff tool.
- **Tags:** feature plan, phase 2, ui, ux, diff, file association

## 1. Overview & Goal

To make the "Swap with Source" feature trustworthy and intuitive, users need a clear visual confirmation of which local file an AI-generated code block is intended to replace. This feature introduces a "file association" mechanism that parses AI responses, verifies the existence of the mentioned files, and displays this status to the user.

**Update (C95):** This plan is now evolved. The "Associated Files" list is not just for verification but is the primary interaction point for viewing changes. Clicking a file in this list now drives the UI, displaying a diff view in an adjacent panel.

## 2. User Stories

| ID | User Story | Acceptance Criteria |
|---|---|---|
| P2-ASSOC-01 | **See Affected Files** | As a developer, when I parse an AI response, I want the extension to automatically show me a list of all the file paths it intends to modify, so I can understand the scope of the proposed changes. | - After parsing, a collapsible "Associated Files" section appears in the tab's UI. <br> - This section displays a list of all file paths found in the response. |
| P2-ASSOC-02 | **Verify File Existence** | As a developer, for each file listed, I want to see a visual indicator of whether that file already exists in my workspace, so I can spot potential errors or new files proposed by the AI. | - Next to each listed file path, an icon is displayed. <br> - A green checkmark (`✓`) indicates the file exists at that path. <br> - A red cross (`✗`) indicates the file does not exist, alerting me to a potential hallucination or a new file creation. |
| P2-ASSOC-03 | **Preview Changes with Diff** | As a developer, I want to click on an existing file in the "Associated Files" list to immediately see a side-by-side comparison of the original file and the AI's proposed changes, so I can review the changes before swapping. | - Clicking a file with a `✓` in the list opens a diff view in a new panel to the right. <br> - The diff view clearly shows added, removed, and common lines. <br> - The diff view is the primary way to inspect changes. |

## 3. Technical Implementation Plan (C95)

1.  **Frontend - Parsing (`response-parser.ts`):**
    *   **Status:** **In Progress.**
    *   The parser will be enhanced to first look for file paths inside angle brackets (e.g., `<src/main.ts>`), making it more robust. It will fall back to parsing list formats if the primary method fails.

2.  **Backend - Verification & Content Fetching (`fs.service.ts`):**
    *   **Status:** **In Progress.**
    *   The `handleFileExistenceRequest` handler will be enhanced to intelligently check for documentation artifacts in the `src/Artifacts/` directory if they are not found at the root.
    *   A **new handler**, `handleFileContentRequest`, will be created. It will receive a file path from the client, read that file's content, and send it back.

3.  **Frontend - UI & State (`view.tsx`):**
    *   **Status:** **In Progress.**
    *   The UI will be refactored into a two-pane layout when in parsed mode.
    *   New state variables `diffTarget` and `originalFileContent` will be added.
    *   The `AssociatedFilesList` component will be made clickable.
    *   **Workflow:**
        1.  User clicks a file in the list.
        2.  The `onClick` handler sets the `diffTarget` state to the corresponding `ParsedFile` object from the response.
        3.  It then sends a `RequestFileContent` IPC message to the backend.
        4.  The `onmessage` handler for `SendFileContent` receives the original file's text and sets the `originalFileContent` state.
        5.  The `DiffViewer` component, which is already present in the right pane, now has both `original` and `modified` props and renders the diff.
