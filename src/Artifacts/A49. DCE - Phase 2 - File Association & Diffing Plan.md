# Artifact A49: DCE - Phase 2 - File Association & Diffing Plan
# Date Created: C82
# Author: AI Model
# Updated on: C99 (Add auto-diff and hover logging to debug plan)

- **Key/Value for A0:**
- **Description:** Plans the UI and backend logic to visually link file blocks in an AI response to workspace files and sets the stage for an integrated diff tool.
- **Tags:** feature plan, phase 2, ui, ux, diff, file association

## 1. Overview & Goal

To make the "Swap with Source" feature trustworthy and intuitive, users need a clear visual confirmation of which local file an AI-generated code block is intended to replace. This feature introduces a "file association" mechanism that parses AI responses, verifies the existence of the mentioned files, and displays this status to the user.

**Update (C95):** This plan is now evolved. The "Associated Files" list is not just for verification but is the primary interaction point for viewing changes. Clicking a file in this list now drives the UI, displaying a diff view in an adjacent panel.

## 2. User Stories

| ID | User Story | Acceptance Criteria |
|---|---|---|
| P2-ASSOC-01 | **See Affected Files** | As a developer, when I parse an AI response, I want the extension to automatically show me a list of all the file paths it intends to modify, so I can understand the scope of the proposed changes. | - After parsing, a collapsible "Associated Files" section appears in the tab's UI. <br> - This section displays a list of all file paths found in the response. |
| P2-ASSOC-02 | **Verify File Existence** | As a developer, for each file listed, I want to see a visual indicator of whether that file already exists in my workspace, so I can spot potential errors or new files proposed by the AI. | - Next to each listed file path, an icon is displayed. <br> - A green checkmark (`✓`) indicates the file exists at that path. <br> - A red cross (`✗`) indicates the file does not exist, alerting me to a potential hallucination or a new file creation. |
| P2-ASSOC-03 | **Preview Changes with Diff** | As a developer, I want to click on an existing file in the "Associated Files" list to immediately see a side-by-side comparison of the original file and the AI's proposed changes, so I can review the changes before swapping. | - Clicking a file with a `✓` in the list opens a diff view in a new panel to the right. <br> - The diff view clearly shows added, removed, and common lines. <br> - **(C99 Update)** The diff view automatically loads with the *first valid file* upon parsing. |

## 3. Technical Implementation Plan (C99)

1.  **Frontend - Parsing (`response-parser.ts`):**
    *   **Status:** **Complete.**

2.  **Backend - Verification & Content Fetching (`fs.service.ts`):**
    *   **Status:** **Complete.**

3.  **Frontend - UI & State (`view.tsx`):**
    *   **Status:** **Debugging.** The diff view is not appearing on manual click.
    *   **Auto-Diff Logic (New in C99):**
        *   A new `useEffect` hook will be added. It will trigger when `isParsedMode`, `activeTabData`, and `fileExistenceMap` are all populated.
        *   It will find the first file path in `activeTabData.parsedContent.filesUpdated` that is `true` in the `fileExistenceMap`.
        *   If found, it will call the existing `handleSelectForDiff` function to automatically load the diff for that file.
    *   **Debugging Plan (C99 - Escalated):**
        *   **Step 1 (Hover Logging):** Add `onMouseEnter` and `onMouseLeave` handlers to the `<li>` element for each associated file. These handlers will only call `logger.log()`. This will prove whether basic mouse events are being registered by the component.
        *   **Step 2 (Click Logging):** Ensure a `logger.log()` statement is the *very first line* inside the `onClick` handler for the `<li>` element. If the hover logs from Step 1 appear but this click log does not, the click event is being blocked by a CSS overlay or another component.
        *   **Step 3 (Trace Data Flow):** Add logs at every subsequent step of the data flow (IPC send, backend receive, file read, IPC response, frontend receive) to trace the entire process from click to render.
