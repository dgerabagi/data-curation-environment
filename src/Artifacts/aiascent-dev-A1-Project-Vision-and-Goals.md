## 1. Project Vision

The vision of **aiascent.dev** is to create a professional and engaging promotional website for the **Data Curation Environment (DCE) VS Code Extension**. The website will serve as the primary public-facing hub for the DCE project, explaining its value proposition and demonstrating its power. It aims to be more than a static landing page; it will be a living testament to the capabilities of the DCE by showcasing complex, interactive components that were themselves built using the extension.

## 2. High-Level Goals & Phases

The project will be developed in distinct phases to ensure an iterative and manageable workflow.

### Phase 1: Core Website and Interactive Whitepaper

The goal of this phase is to establish the foundational website and deliver the primary showcase content.
-   **Core Functionality:**
    -   Build a static website shell based on the `automationsaas` project, including a landing page, header, and footer.
    -   Port the "Report Viewer" component from `aiascent.game` and refactor it into a reusable "Interactive Whitepaper" component.
    -   Integrate the content of the DCE whitepaper (`A78`) into the interactive viewer.
-   **Outcome:** A functional website at `aiascent.dev` where visitors can learn about the DCE and explore the full interactive whitepaper, demonstrating a key product built with the tool.

### Phase 2: Vibe Coding Tutorials and Blog

This phase will build upon the foundation by adding educational content to foster a community and teach the "vibe coding" methodology.
-   **Core Functionality:**
    -   Create a new section on the website for tutorials.
    -   Develop the first set of interactive tutorials explaining the "Vibecoding to Virtuosity" pathway.
    -   Implement a simple blog or articles section for development updates and conceptual deep-dives.
-   **Outcome:** The website becomes an educational resource for users wanting to master AI-assisted development with the DCE.

### Phase 3: Community and Integration Features

This phase focuses on community building and deeper integration with the DCE ecosystem.
-   **Core Functionality:**
    -   Potentially add a community forum or Discord integration.
    -   Explore features like a showcase of projects built with the DCE.
    -   Provide direct download links for the DCE extension's `.vsix` file.
-   **Outcome:** `aiascent.dev` becomes the central community hub for the Data Curation Environment project.
