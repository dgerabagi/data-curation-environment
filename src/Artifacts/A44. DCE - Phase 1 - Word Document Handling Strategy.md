# Artifact A44: DCE - Phase 1 - Word Document Handling Strategy
# Date Created: C73
# Author: AI Model
# Updated on: C81 (Add handling for corrupted .docx files)

- **Key/Value for A0:**
- **Description:** Defines the strategy for handling Word document files (.docx) by converting them to text on-demand and caching them in memory for flattening.
- **Tags:** feature plan, docx, text extraction, virtualization, cache, phase 1

## 1. Overview & Goal

To further expand the data curation capabilities of the extension, users need to be able to include the content of Microsoft Word documents (`.docx`). Following the successful virtualization pattern used for PDFs and Excel files, the goal is to extract text from Word documents on-demand and hold it in an in-memory cache. This allows their content to be included in the flattened context without creating temporary files in the user's workspace.

## 2. Supported & Unsupported Formats

-   **Supported:** This strategy focuses exclusively on the modern, XML-based **`.docx`** format.
-   **Unsupported:** The legacy binary **`.doc`** format is significantly more complex to parse and is **not supported**. The extension will identify `.doc` files and insert a placeholder in the flattened output rather than attempting to process them.

## 3. User Stories

| ID | User Story | Acceptance Criteria |
|---|---|---|
| DOCX-01 | **Include Word Document Text in Context** | As a user, when I check a `.docx` file, I want its text content to be extracted and included in the `flattened_repo.md`, so I can use reports and documents as context for the LLM. | - Checking `.docx` files is allowed. <br> - The token count displayed for the file reflects its extracted text content. <br> - When flattened, the text from the document is included within a `<file>` tag. <br> - No temporary files are created in the user's workspace. |
| DOCX-02 | **Handle Unsupported `.doc` format** | As a user, when I check a legacy `.doc` file, I want the system to acknowledge it but inform me in the output that its content could not be processed, so I am not confused by missing data or corrupted text. | - Checking `.doc` files is allowed. <br> - The token count for `.doc` files remains 0. <br> - When flattened, a clear placeholder comment is included for the `.doc` file, stating that the format is unsupported. |
| DOCX-03 | **Handle Corrupted `.docx` files** | As a user, if I check a `.docx` file that is corrupted or invalid, I want the extension to fail gracefully and show me an error in the UI, so I know the file has a problem. | - The extension attempts to parse the `.docx` file. <br> - If parsing fails due to file corruption (e.g., it's not a valid zip archive), the token count is set to 0. <br> - An error message (e.g., "File may be corrupted") is displayed in the file's tooltip in the UI. <br> - The flattened output includes a comment indicating the failure. |

## 4. Technical Implementation Plan

1.  **Dependency:**
    *   The `mammoth` library will be added to `package.json`. It is a popular and effective library for converting `.docx` files to HTML and raw text.

2.  **Backend (`fs.service.ts`):**
    *   **In-Memory Cache:** A new private cache will be added: `private wordTextCache = new Map<string, { text: string; tokenCount: number }>();`.
    *   **New IPC Handler (`RequestWordToText`):**
        *   This handler will receive a file path. It will first check the cache.
        *   **If `.doc`:** It will cache an "Unsupported Format" message and a token count of 0, then notify the client.
        *   **If `.docx`:** It will read the file buffer and attempt to parse it with `mammoth.extractRawText()`.
        *   **Success:** On success, it will calculate the token count, store the result in the cache, and send the stats to the client.
        *   **Failure:** The `try...catch` block will inspect the error. If the error message indicates a corrupted file (e.g., from `jszip`), it will create a specific, user-friendly error message and send that to the client with a token count of 0.

3.  **Frontend (`view.tsx`):**
    *   **On-Demand Extraction:** The logic for handling checked files and restored selections will be updated to send a `RequestWordToText` message to the backend for `.docx` and `.doc` files.

4.  **Backend (`flattener.service.ts`):**
    *   **Virtual Content Retrieval:** The flattener will retrieve the text from the `wordTextCache` in the `FSService` instead of reading the binary file. It will correctly handle the "Unsupported Format" and "Corrupted File" messages from the cache.
