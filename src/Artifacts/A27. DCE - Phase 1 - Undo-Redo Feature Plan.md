# Artifact A27: DCE - Phase 1 - Undo-Redo Feature Plan
# Date Created: C35
# Author: AI Model
# Updated on: C10 (Mark as active implementation)

- **Key/Value for A0:**
- **Description:** Details the requirements for implementing an undo/redo stack for file system operations (move, delete) performed within the DCE view, to achieve parity with the native explorer's Ctrl+Z functionality.
- **Tags:** feature plan, undo, redo, ctrl+z, file operations, ux, phase 1

## 1. Overview & Goal

A critical feature for achieving parity with the native VS Code Explorer is the ability to undo file system operations. Users expect to be able to press `Ctrl+Z` to revert an accidental file move or deletion. The goal of this feature is to implement a robust undo/redo stack for file operations initiated from within the Data Curation Environment view.

**Status (C10):** In Progress.

## 2. User Stories

| ID | User Story | Acceptance Criteria |
|---|---|---|
| UR-01 | **Undo File Move** | As a user, after I drag and drop a file to a new location, I want to be able to press `Ctrl+Z` to move it back to its original location, so I can easily correct mistakes. | - Performing a file/folder move pushes an "action" object onto an undo stack. <br> - Pressing `Ctrl+Z` while the DCE view is focused pops the last action and reverses it (moves the file back). <br> - The file tree updates to reflect the reversed move. |
| UR-02 | **Undo File Deletion** | As a user, after I delete a file or folder (to the trash), I want to be able to press `Ctrl+Z` to restore it, so I don't lose work accidentally. | - Deleting a file/folder pushes an "action" object onto the undo stack. <br> - Pressing `Ctrl+Z` reverses the deletion. Since we use `useTrash: true`, this might be handled by a native VS Code command, or we may need to implement a restore from trash mechanism if possible. |
| UR-03 | **Redo Operation** | As a user, after I undo an action, I want to be able to press `Ctrl+Y` (or `Ctrl+Shift+Z`) to redo the action, so I can toggle between states. | - Undoing an action moves it from the undo stack to a redo stack. <br> - Pressing `Ctrl+Y` pops the last action from the redo stack and re-applies it. <br> - The file tree updates accordingly. |

## 3. Technical Implementation Plan

This feature will be implemented primarily on the backend to manage the file system state and the action history.

1.  **Action Stack Service (New Backend Service):**
    *   Create a new service, `action.service.ts`, to manage the undo and redo stacks.
    *   It will contain two arrays: `undoStack: Action[]` and `redoStack: Action[]`.
    *   An `Action` will be a typed object, e.g., `{ type: 'move', payload: { from: string, to: string } }` or `{ type: 'delete', payload: { path: string } }`.
    *   It will expose methods: `push(action: Action)`, `undo()`, and `redo()`.
        *   `push`: Adds an action to `undoStack` and clears `redoStack`.
        *   `undo`: Pops from `undoStack`, performs the reverse operation, and pushes the original action to `redoStack`.
        *   `redo`: Pops from `redoStack`, performs the original operation, and pushes it back to `undoStack`.

2.  **Integrate with `file-operation.service.ts`:**
    *   The `handleMoveFileRequest` and `handleFileDeleteRequest` methods in `file-operation.service.ts` will be updated.
    *   *Before* performing the file system operation, they will create the corresponding `Action` object.
    *   *After* the operation succeeds, they will call `Services.actionService.push(action)`.

3.  **IPC Channels and Commands:**
    *   Create two new `ClientToServerChannel` entries: `RequestUndo` and `RequestRedo`.
    *   The frontend (`TreeView.tsx`) will have a top-level `onKeyDown` handler. When `Ctrl+Z` or `Ctrl+Y` is detected, it will send the appropriate IPC message to the backend.
    *   Create two new backend commands, `dce.undo` and `dce.redo`, which will be called by the message handlers. These commands will simply call `Services.actionService.undo()` and `Services.actionService.redo()`.

4.  **Reverse Operations Logic (`action.service.ts`):**
    *   The `undo()` method will contain the logic to reverse actions.
    *   **Move:** To undo a move from `A` to `B`, it calls `vscode.workspace.fs.rename(B, A)`.
    *   **Delete:** Undoing a delete is more complex. Since we use `useTrash: true`, VS Code might not expose a direct API to "un-delete". Research is needed. The simplest approach might be to leverage a built-in command like `files.restoreFromTrash` if it can be targeted, or we may need to inform the user to use the native Explorer's undo for deletions. For a first pass, we might only support undo for **move** operations.

5.  **Frontend Focus:**
    *   The main `TreeView` component needs to be focusable (`tabIndex="0"`) to capture the keyboard shortcuts. The `onKeyDown` handler will check for `event.ctrlKey` and the specific key (`z` or `y`) and then send the IPC message.
