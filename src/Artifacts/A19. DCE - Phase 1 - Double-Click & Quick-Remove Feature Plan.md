# Artifact A19: DCE - Phase 1 - File Interaction Plan (Click & Remove)
# Date Created: Cycle 26
# Author: AI Model
# Updated on: C28 (Changed interaction model from double-click to single-click to open files)

- **Key/Value for A0:**
- **Description:** Details the requirements for opening files by single-clicking them and quickly removing single files from the selection list via a mouse-over action.
- **Tags:** feature plan, single-click, open file, quick remove, ux, phase 1

## 1. Overview & Goal

To further align the Data Curation Environment with standard, intuitive user workflows, this plan introduces two high-impact interaction enhancements. The first is the ability to **single-click** any file to open it in the main editor, mimicking the native VS Code Explorer behavior. The second is a "quick-remove" feature in the "Selected Items" panel, allowing for rapid, single-click removal of files. The goal is to reduce friction and increase the speed at which a user can curate their context.

## 2. User Stories

| ID | User Story | Acceptance Criteria |
|---|---|---|
| UX-01 | **Single-Click to Open (Main Tree)** | As a user, I want to be able to single-click on a file in the main "Data Curation" file tree and have it open in the editor, so I can quickly view its contents just like in the native Explorer. | - A single click on a file item (not a folder) in the main file tree opens that file in the main VS Code editor pane. <br> - If the file is already open in a tab, the editor switches focus to that tab. <br> - A single click on a folder still expands or collapses it. |
| UX-02 | **Single-Click to Open (Selected List)** | As a user, I want to single-click a file in the "Selected Items" list to open it, so I can easily inspect the files that are contributing the most tokens to my context. | - A single click on a file item in the "Selected Items" list opens that file in the main VS Code editor pane. <br> - If the file is already open, focus is switched to its tab. |
| UX-03 | **Quick Remove from Selection** | As a user, after selecting a large folder, I want to quickly remove a single file from the "Selected Items" list with one click, so I don't have to select it and then click the "Remove Selected" button. | - In the "Selected Items" list, when I mouse over a file row, the row number (in the `#` column) is replaced by an 'X' icon. <br> - Clicking the 'X' icon immediately removes that single file from the selection. <br> - This action is equivalent to selecting only that file and clicking "Remove Selected". <br> - The mouse leaving the row restores the row number. |

## 3. Technical Implementation Plan

1.  **IPC Channel (`channels.enum.ts`, `channels.type.ts`):**
    *   The existing `ClientToServerChannel.RequestOpenFile` is sufficient.
    *   The `ChannelBody` remains `{ path: string }`.

2.  **Backend Handler (`on-message.ts`, `fs.service.ts`):**
    *   The existing handler for `RequestOpenFile` in `fs.service.ts` is sufficient. It uses `vscode.workspace.openTextDocument` and `vscode.window.showTextDocument`.

3.  **Frontend - Single-Click (`TreeView.tsx`, `SelectedFilesView.tsx`):**
    *   In `TreeView.tsx`, the main `onClick` handler (`handleToggleNode`) will be modified. It will now check if the clicked node is a file or a directory.
        *   If it's a file, it will call `clientIpc.sendToServer(ClientToServerChannel.RequestOpenFile, ...)`.
        *   If it's a directory, it will perform the existing expand/collapse logic.
    *   In `SelectedFilesView.tsx`, the `onDoubleClick` handler will be removed and the `onClick` handler will be simplified to *only* open the file, as the multi-selection logic is handled by checking for modifier keys (`ctrlKey`, `shiftKey`).

4.  **Frontend - Quick Remove (`SelectedFilesView.tsx`, `view.scss`):**
    *   **State:** A state variable will track the hovered item's path: `const [hoveredPath, setHoveredPath] = useState<string | null>(null);`.
    *   **Event Handlers:** Add `onMouseEnter` and `onMouseLeave` to the `<li>` element to update the hover state.
    *   **Conditional Rendering:** In the JSX for the index column, render conditionally: if the row is hovered, show an 'X' icon with an `onClick` handler; otherwise, show the row number.
    *   **Styling:** Add styles for the `.quick-remove` class in `view.scss` to ensure it's clickable and has appropriate hover effects.
    *   The `onClick` handler for the 'X' icon will call the existing `onRemove` prop and use `stopPropagation` to prevent the click from also selecting the row.
