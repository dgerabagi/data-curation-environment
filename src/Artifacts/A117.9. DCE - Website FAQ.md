## 1. Purpose

This document provides answers to frequently asked questions about the Data Curation Environment (DCE) VS Code extension. It is intended to be used as a knowledge base for the new `aiascent.dev` promotional website.

## 2. Frequently Asked Questions

### General Concepts

**Q: What is the Data Curation Environment (DCE)?**

A: The Data Curation Environment (DCE) is a VS Code extension designed to streamline and enhance the workflow of AI-assisted software development. It provides an integrated toolset for selecting, managing, and packaging the context (code files, documents, etc.) you provide to Large Language Models (LLMs), and for managing the responses you get back.

**Q: What problem does DCE solve?**

A: DCE solves the problem of "context management." Modern AI development requires providing the AI with a precise and comprehensive set of files as context. Manually creating and updating this context is tedious, error-prone, and inefficient. DCE automates this process, allowing you to focus on the creative and strategic aspects of development.

**Q: Who is DCE for?**

A: DCE is for any developer, project manager, or technical writer who uses AI to help build, document, or manage software projects. It is particularly powerful for those who engage in an iterative, conversational workflow with AI and want to bring structure, efficiency, and auditability to that process.

### Core Features

**Q: What is the "Context Chooser"?**

A: The Context Chooser is the file tree view provided by DCE. It allows you to select files and folders for your AI context using simple checkboxes, replacing the need to manually manage a list of files. It also provides valuable metadata, like token counts and Git status, for each file.

**Q: What does the "Flatten Context" button do?**

A: This button takes all the files and folders you have "checked" in the Context Chooser, reads their content, and packages them into a single, formatted `flattened_repo.md` file. This file, along with your instructions, becomes the input for the AI.

**Q: What is the "Parallel Co-Pilot Panel" (PCPP)?**

A: The PCPP is the main interface for managing the iterative development workflow. It allows you to paste multiple, parallel responses from an AI into different tabs for side-by-side comparison. It includes features for parsing responses, diffing them against your local files, and accepting the AI's changes into your workspace.

**Q: What are "Cycles"?**

A: A "Cycle" represents one complete loop of the development process: writing a prompt (your "Cycle Context"), getting AI responses, and integrating the chosen solution. The DCE organizes your entire project history into these cycles, creating a navigable "knowledge graph" of your project's evolution.

### Workflow

**Q: What is the recommended workflow with DCE?**

A: The core workflow, which we call the "perfect loop," is:
1.  **Curate Context:** Use the Context Chooser to select the relevant files.
2.  **Generate Prompt:** Use the "Generate prompt.md" button to package your context and instructions.
3.  **Get Responses:** Use the generated prompt with your preferred AI model (e.g., via AI Studio, ChatGPT).
4.  **Paste & Parse:** Paste the AI's responses into the Parallel Co-Pilot Panel and parse them.
5.  **Review & Select:** Compare the responses, review the diffs, and select the best one.
6.  **Baseline & Accept:** Create a Git baseline (a safe restore point) and accept the AI's changes into your code.
7.  **Test & Iterate:** Test the new code. If it's not right, use the "Restore" button to revert and try a different response.
8.  **Start New Cycle:** Once you're satisfied, write your notes for the next task and begin the next cycle.

**Q: What are "Artifacts"?**

A: Artifacts are formal, written documents (like plans, guides, and requirements) that serve as the "source of truth" for your project. The DCE workflow is built on the principle of "Documentation First," where you and the AI collaborate to create and update these artifacts before writing code.

**Q: How does DCE work with Git?**

A: DCE is designed to work hand-in-hand with Git. The "Baseline (Commit)" and "Restore Baseline" features leverage Git to allow you to safely test AI-generated code. You can create a commit as a restore point before accepting changes, and then instantly revert your entire workspace if the changes don't work as expected.

### Local LLM / Demo Mode

**Q: Can I use DCE with my own local AI model?**

A: Yes. DCE has a "Demo Mode" that is pre-configured to connect to a local vLLM instance with an OpenAI-compatible API. You can also configure it in the settings to point to any custom OpenAI-compatible endpoint URL.

**Q: What is "vLLM" and why is it used?**

A: vLLM is a high-throughput serving engine for LLMs. We use it for our "Demo Mode" because its parallel processing capabilities allow the DCE to generate multiple, simultaneous responses with very low latency, showcasing the full power of the parallel workflow.

**Q: What is the difference between "Manual Mode" and "Demo Mode"?**

A:
*   **Manual Mode:** This is the default, free mode. You generate a `prompt.md` file and manually copy/paste it to your preferred AI service. You then paste the AI's response back into the DCE.
*   **Demo Mode:** This is an automated mode. When you click "Generate responses," the DCE sends the prompt directly to your configured local LLM, and the responses are streamed back into the UI in real-time.

### Troubleshooting & Technical

**Q: Why do my AI responses sometimes fail to parse?**

A: The DCE's parser expects the AI's response to follow a specific format (e.g., using `<summary>` and `<file path="...">` tags). If the AI deviates from this format, parsing can fail. The "Harmony" interaction schema (used in Demo Mode) is designed to be more robust by requesting a structured JSON output, which significantly reduces parsing errors.

**Q: Where is my project data (cycles, responses) stored?**

A: All of your project's cycle history, including your notes and the raw AI responses, is stored locally in a single file: `.vscode/dce_history.json` within your project's workspace. This file is not checked into Git by default.

**Q: Is DCE free?**

A: Yes, the DCE extension is free to use. When using it in "Manual Mode," any costs are related to the AI service you choose to use (many, like Google's AI Studio, have generous free tiers). When using it with a local LLM, the only "cost" is the hardware to run the model.
